            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>ARTS</hi> as well as <hi>Habits,</hi> are ſubject to that Fate of being in Mode, as might be inſtanced in ſeveral, beſides this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Art of <hi>Horti-culture:</hi> which never declines when once it is become National, only varies in Form, according to the ſeveral temporary Humours of ſuch that place their Oblectations in it. As for that part of <hi>Gardening,</hi> which is for the propagation of Trees for Pleaſure, and beautifying Seats with vegetative Ornaments, ſcarce any part of the World, but eſtimates it a more than ordinary value. As for that part which is for <hi>Flora's</hi> uſe, the extream hot or cold parts are little adapted to it, thoſe in the temperate Zone the moſt: For theſe luſtrious Beauties affect not <hi>Sol</hi>'s ſcorching rays, nor can their tender lovely Faces endure <hi>Hyem,</hi>'s too great ſeverity; yet of the two extreams, the cold is the moſt tolerable, there being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally more Flowers in the Meadows of the <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Territories, than in thoſe of <hi>Guinea.</hi>
                     <pb n="ij" facs="tcp:100170:3"/> But as for that part that relates to Eſculent Plants, all Nations delight in it for the raiſing of ſuch as are moſt proper for their Climate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Nature it ſelf hath directed us where, and in what parts <hi>Gardens</hi> are to be planted with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, having ſpontaneouſly expoſed to our view many curious Plants; which made <hi>Varro</hi> to ſay, <hi>Divina natura dedit agros:</hi> which is in effect, that divine Nature hath indicated unto us thoſe Grounds that are fit for theſe uſes: There reſts only our Care and Induſtry to Till and Manure them, which was an Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe appropriated unto us from the beginning. That our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Soyl then is generally fit for all theſe Uſes, may appear from its aptneſs to produce naturally ſo great variety of Trees for Beauty and Shade, Flowers for Delight, and edible Plants alſo if they are ſown in it; which is a ſufficient encouragement for the Ingenious farther to proſecute this Art, which is of late years much improved in every part thereof. It was not long ſince that our choiceſt Avenues were firſt planted with thoſe Ornamental Shades that now are become common, and that our beſt <hi>Gardens</hi> were only worthy of thoſe natural Beauties that now flouriſh in every or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>Partir:</hi> Many of our now vulgar Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes of <hi>Tillage,</hi> alſo, were but lately eſteemed as Rarities. And as this <hi>Art</hi> hath with its Subjects encreaſed of late years; ſo have the Inſtructions, or Treatiſes, written to that effect, been multiplied. The affections of our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſo naturally tending that way, have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="iij" facs="tcp:100170:3"/> great encouragement to ſuch Publications, ſome whereof are very large and voluminous; others there are that are more accurt, and treat only of ſome particular Plants, and ways of ordering them. And as the Art it ſelf was at firſt lame, ſo have the Directions for its Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement been; that if an inquiſitive perſon deſires to be informed of the different Ways, Methods, or Means to order his <hi>Garden,</hi> &amp;c. he muſt procure many ſeveral Tracts, and thoſe differing very much in their Rules and Preſcriptions the one from the other, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering many fabulous Stories, and directing you in erroneous ways, affirming them to be true that are meerly ſuppoſitious; <hi>ſome of them are only tranſlated out of other Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, which were written for other Countries, whoſe</hi> Horti-culture (as their Climate) <hi>varies very much from ours.</hi> All which Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences I have here endeavoured to avoid, by contracting into a ſmall Pocket-Volume, the Names of the moſt and principal kinds of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namental Trees and Flowers, with their proper Ways and Methods of ordering; and an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all ſuch Eſculent Plants that are here uſually planted for culinary uſes: Together with the Method and Manner of ſelecting Grounds for <hi>Gardens,</hi> and the making, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and adorning them; and the improving, preſerving, altering or renewing the ſeveral ſorts of Earths, for all hortulane Plants, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in as near as may be I have not troubled you with unneceſſary, inſignificant, uſeleſs, nor
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:100170:4"/> falſe Directions; but have inſerted only ſuch as either I have actually experimented to be true, or have them from Perſons or Authors of good repute; or that are deduced from ſolid Principles. Alſo I have not ſwell'd this ſmall Tract, nor troubled your patience, with the many unneceſſary Names nor Characters of the various ſpecies of Flowers, and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Plants; but nominated the more princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal; the other being, rather to be ſelected when in their prime by your Eye, than confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in from lame Deſcriptions. It is better to truſt to the integrity of a <hi>Gardener,</hi> than ſuch Directions as are uſually written, and ſeem to emblazon the Fame of a poor ſimple Flower, which when you ſee its higheſt luſtre in the beſt part of your <hi>Garden,</hi> (as by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription and the price you gave for it, it ſhould deſerve) you are ready to remove it to the moſt abject place of your Groves. It may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, that there are many things in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe that have been formerly written of, and therefore it ſeems to be ſuperfluous. It is true, very able Pens have written of this Subject; but they themſelves could not write without mentioning ſome things, and thoſe not few, that had been publiſhed before: It being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rare to find a Treatiſe in this Age, wholly of a new Subject; and any would eſteem it a grand deficiency in the improvement of this Art, if none ſhould have written of it ſince Mr. <hi>Parkinſon,</hi> Sir <hi>Hugh Platt, Meager,</hi> and ſeveral others, becauſe theſe had written before
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:100170:4"/> on the fame Subject. I hope therefore that this Objection will have no place againſt this Tract, the rather, becauſe it hath the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters (that Mr. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath propoſed in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle Dedicatory, before his <hi>Treatiſe of Fruit-Trees)</hi> that Books of this nature ſhould have, Viz. 1. <hi>That they be of ſmall Bulk and Price,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I hope I have conformed, conſidering the variety of Matter herein Diſcourſed of 2. <hi>Then the Stile be plain, and ſuited to the Vulgar:</hi> In this I am ſure I have not tranſgreſſed: for I have wav'd as near as I could, all hard Words, and intricate Expreſſions (now in Mode) not in any wiſe ſuitable to this plain, honeſt, and ruſlick Employment. 3. <hi>That theſe Books for Inſtruction, be Experimental:</hi> As to this propoſal I have exactly obſerved it. You will alſo find ſeveral Matters here treated of, that have not as yet been mentioned in any Book of this kind, and many Experiments very uſeful and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, that were never made publick before. My principal deſign being not only to excite or animate ſuch as have fair Eſtates, and pleaſant Seats in the Country, to adorn and beautifie them; but to encourage the honeſt and plain Countryman in the improvement of his Ville, by enlarging the bounds and limits of his <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> as well as his <hi>Orchards,</hi> for the encreaſe of ſuch Eſculent Plants as may be uſeful and beneficial to himſelf and his Neighbors. Many there are in this Kingdom, that out of ſmall portions of Land, have by their Induſtry and Ingenuity in this very way of Improvement,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:100170:5"/> maintained themſelves and their Families, and acquired over and above wherewith to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large their Poſſeſſions. Several parts beyond the Seas, in <hi>Holland, Flanders, France, Switzerland,</hi> (of a near temperature of Air with us) can ſhew multitudes of Examples of this nature: <hi>Italy</hi> alſo in <hi>Pliny</hi>'s time, now the <hi>Garden</hi> of the World, was then improvable by this way of Tillage: As appears' by that Hiſtory of <hi>C. Furius Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinus,</hi> who out of a ſmall piece of ground raiſed more advantage, than his Neighbours out of their greater Poſſeſſions; but then not without the Imputation of Sorcery; ſuch was the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Envy of that Age.</p>
                  <p>In this Country, in many places, Ignorance, Sloth, and Envy, are great impediments to this way of Improvement; no Country in the World being without ſome perſons fraught with lazy and envious Humors. Therefore we cannot be exempt from them, the beſt of Airs naturally nouriſhing the worſt of Animals, and the beſt of <hi>Gardens</hi> naturally producing the worſt of Weeds.</p>
                  <p>As for ſlothful men, they are the greateſt burthen to themſelves; but envious men, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they are ſo great an afflicton to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, (as <hi>Horace</hi> obſerved, that the <hi>Sicilian</hi> Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants never invented the like Torment) yet are they alſo the worſt Neighbors to good Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, not only by a conſtant depraving the endeavours and ingenuity of the Induſtrious, but uſing all means they can to impede or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their proſperity: Like unto him that poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
<pb n="vij" facs="tcp:100170:5"/> the Flowers in his own <hi>Garden,</hi> becauſe his Neighbor's Bees ſhould get no more Honey from them.

                     <p>The Original of <hi>Gardens</hi> was from a Divine Hand: And they alſo long ſince delighted in by the wifeſt of Kings, and in the principal e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem ever ſince by the beſt of Men: The Heathen dedicated them to <hi>Priapus</hi> the Son of <hi>Venus,</hi> and celebrated them as Objects of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and Delight, and left their immortal Names to Poſterity; as the <hi>Gardens</hi> of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperides, Adonis, Alcinous,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <hi>Tarquin</hi> the proud, (a <hi>Roman</hi> King) thought no place more worthy than his <hi>Garden</hi> to give Audience to an Ambaſſador ſent unto him: And the Glory and Pride of the <hi>Romans</hi> in the time of their Emperors, was in nothing more ſeen than in their <hi>Gardens,</hi> which for the infinite delight they took in them, they dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to <hi>Venus</hi> their Goddeſs of Pleaſure, and gloried more in their Chaplets and Garlands of curious Greens and Flowers, than our vain Contemporaries now do in their richeſt party-coloured Habits, which he that reads what <hi>Pliny</hi> obſerved of them will readily believe.</p>

                     <p> The learned Dr. <hi>Brown</hi> in his Tract of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, takes notice, that the uſe of flowry Crowns and Garlands, is of no ſlender Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; for beſides the old <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans;</hi> the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> made uſe of them at their Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val Compotations: And that this practice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as far as <hi>India:</hi> For at the Feaſt with the <hi>Indian</hi> King, it is peculiarly obſerved by <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtratus,</hi> that their Cuſtom was to wear <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi> and come crowned with them to their Feaſts.</p>
                     <p>The uſe of them alſo was very frequent and common, the ends thereof being many; for they were <hi>Convivial,</hi> wherein they had reſpect unto Plants, preventing drunkenneſs; or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing the exhalations from Wine. <hi>Feſtival,</hi> their ſolemn Feſtival Garlands being made properly unto their Gods, and according contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Plants ſacred unto ſuch Deities. <hi>Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial,</hi> which were ſelected under ſuch conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Honorary</hi> Crowns were Triumphal, Ovary, Civical, or Obſidional, and had little of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers in them, being made generally of Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, <hi>&amp;c. Funebrial</hi> Garlands, which had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of beauty in them beſides Roſes, while they made them of Myrtle, Roſemary, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> under ſymbolical Intimations. But our florid and purely ornamental Garlands, delightful unto Sight and Smell; not framed according to myſtical and ſymbolical Conſiderations, are of more free election; and ſo may be made to excel thoſe of the Ancients: We having <hi>China, India,</hi> and a New World to ſupply us,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100170:10"/> beſides the great diſtinction of Flowers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known unto Antiquity, and the varieties here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ariſing from Art and Nature.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Italians,</hi> in the time of their ancient Glory, thought no Palace nor Habitation com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat without its <hi>Garden,</hi> on which they ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for no coſt, as well in their forming them, as for the naturalizing ſeveral exotic Plants they brought from <hi>Africa,</hi> and other foreign places. which <hi>Gardens</hi> they have from Age to Age ſo improved, that it is now become it ſelf the <hi>Garden</hi> of the World. And as Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture, that ſplendid Art, hath ſpread it ſelf with other Sciences, into theſe <hi>Northern</hi> Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, ſo hath the Art of <hi>Gardening</hi> been hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along with it, as though the former were imperfect without the latter. The Glory of the <hi>French</hi> Palaces, ſo often repreſented to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> eyes in Sculpture, are adorn'd with their beauteous <hi>Gardens</hi> before them; which wanting, they would ſeem without luſtre or grandeur.</p>
                     <p>Neither is there a noble or pleaſant Seat in <hi>England,</hi> but hath its <hi>Gardens</hi> for Pleaſure and Delight; ſcarce an ingenuous Citizen that by his confinement to a Shop, being denied the privilege of having a real <hi>Garden,</hi> but hath his Boxes, Pots, or other receptacles for Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, Plants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in imitation of it: What curious Repreſentations of Banquets of Fruits, Flower-pots, <hi>Gardens,</hi> and ſuch like, are paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Life, to pleaſe the eye, and ſatisfie the fancy of ſuch, that either cannot obtain
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100170:10"/> the felicity of enjoying them in reality, or to ſupply the defect the Winter annually brings?</p>
                     <p>So that we may without vanity conclude, that a <hi>Garden</hi> of pleaſant Avenues, Walks, Fruits, Flowers, Grots, and other Branches ſpringing from it, well compoſed, is the only compleat and permanent inanimate object of delight the World affords, ever complying with our various and mutable Minds, ſeeding us, and ſupplying our Fancies with daily Novels.</p>
                     <p>All curious pieces of Architecture, Limning, Painting, or whatever elſe that ſeem pleaſant to the eye or other ſenſes at firſt ſight or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, at length become dull by too long acquaintance with them.

                           <p>Therefore as near as you can, let the Soyl be good, deep, and light, that Trees and Til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage may proſper in it, and then you need not queſtion but Flowers will thrive there: Let it have the free and open Air to the <hi>Eaſt</hi>

If the whole <hi>Garden</hi> be at ſome diſtance defended by tall Trees, it will very much break the fierce Winds, and ferene Airs, that in the Winter and Spring uſually annoy the moſt delicate Plants and Flowers, and will alſo yield a cooling, refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſweet, and healthy Air and Shade, in the hotteſt Seaſons.</p>
                           <p>If the Soyl be dry and warm, a plain Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel is beſt for a <hi>Garden,</hi> but if it be cold or moiſt, then declining or ſhelving towards the Sun, is the beſt poſition; becauſe by Foſſes, or by the Walks, only the Water naturally glides from it. And in ſuch a <hi>Garden,</hi> Trees, Plants, and Flowers, will thrive exceedingly.</p>

                           <p>LAnds are uſually inclinable to Loam, Clay, Chalk, Marle, or Sand.</p>
                           <p>A Loamy Land is uſually free, and apt to Vegetation, warm and eaſie to Till, the ſadder the Colour the better; if it be free from Stones and Gravel, with a ſandy mixture and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low withal, it is eſteemed the beſt for <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> for the moſt ſorts of Fruits and Flowers.</p>
                           <p>There is much Land that is mixed with Clay in too great a proportion, which maketh it apt to bind, and is cold and moiſt in the Winter ſeaſon, retaining wet too much, and apt to chap in the Summer; it is injurious to moſt Fruits and Flowers, and therefore hath moſt need of help of any other.</p>
                           <p>Chalky Land is generally very ſweet, and kind to many Plants that are not very tender, it being cold in the Winter, and ſuffers not its Plants to put forth early in the Spring; it is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100170:13"/> not difficult to be corrected, and made more natural to the choiceſt Fruits and Flowers.</p>
                           <p>Marle is a very good mixture in Land, ſo that it be not in too great a quantity, it being much of the nature of Chalk, but eaſier to be tilled and improved.</p>
                           <p>Sandy Land is very warm and free, very apt for Vegetation, and amicable to moſt of our choiceſt Fruits and Flowers; but if the Sand predominate, it will require a conſtant ſupply of proper Soyls to enrich it.</p>

                           <head>SECT. III. <hi>Of the Improvement of ſuch Soyls.</hi>
                           </head>
                           <p>THere are many parcels of Land lying near Towns, Villages, and Houſes, that are of that excellent mixture of Loam, and other Earths, that they are capable to entertain moſt of the delicate Fruits, Flowers, and other Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities, that are fit to be planted or propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in your beſt Partirs, without any other mixture or compoſition, other than convenient dung of Oxen, Cows, Sheep, Pullen, Pidgeons, and ſometimes old and rotten Horſe-dung, to preſerve it in its due and wonted fertility; it being by continual weeding, and the attraction of the Plants you furniſh it withal, apt to ſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize. So that where your ground is thus natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fertile and prone to vegitate, you need take
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:100170:13"/> no other care than to apply proper Soyls or Compoſitions, according as the nature of your Plant requires, or to maintain it in its full vigour.</p>
                           <p>Claiy-Land being cold, moiſt, and ſtiff, is to be converted by labour, and mixtures of a contrary nature; if you dig it often, the Sun, Rain, and Froſt will make it more friable and fertile: For take Clay, and lay it on any other Land, it will in time diſſolve, and unite in minute parts with it, that you ſhall hardly diſcern it; ſo alſo it will be much altered by culture on its own Baſis, the wet being care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully drawn from it by declining Canals for that purpoſe, Water being the only thing that maintains its ſtubborn nature, if it reſt on it.</p>
                           <p>But to accelerate the operation, and make it ſpeedily more benign; Sand is an excellent Ingredient, eſpecially that taken up in the bottoms of Rivers, or where haſty currents have left it at the foot of Hills, or Sea-ſand where it may be had. Any old Thatch or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Vegetables, as Weeds, Fern, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> buried in the Trenches as you dig it, drains the wet from it, and makes it more mellow. But above a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, Peat-aſhes, Turf-aſhes, or any Aſhes proportionably, and well mixed, is the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Improvement, you can add to your cold, ſtiff, and moiſt Land. There are ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Additions that will improve it, as Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten-wood, Saw-duſt, the bottoms of Piles of Wood great and ſmall; but theſe being not to be had in any great quantity, will ſerve on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in theſe Beds, where you intend to plant
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:100170:14"/> your choiceſt Flowers; but Chalk, Lime, Marle, and ſuch like, although they ſweeten it at the firſt, yet in the end it unites with the Clay, and is ſoon converted into its own nature.</p>
                           <p>Chalky-Land uſually yields a good rich ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, therefore you muſt avoid planting too deep in it, and where you can with conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, the ſinking your Walks, and with the ſame matter to raiſe your Borders, is a very good Improvement of this ſort of Land. You may alſo deal with it, as with the Claiy-Land, though in a more moderate way, for Chalky-Land is naturally cold, and therefore requires warm Applications; and is alſo ſad, and will the better bear with light Compoſts, which is the reaſon that Chalk is ſo great an improver of light, hot and dry Grounds, eſpecially ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuffered a Calcination.</p>
                           <p>Lands ſeated on Marle, are uſually very rich, although cold and heavy; you need not doubt of the depth of it: for the turning it up, and expoſing it to the Air, converts it into good Earth; a mixture of light and warm Soyl exceedingly advantages it.</p>
                           <p>Sandy-Lands, or Land that hath a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent mixture of Sand in it, is the warmeſt and lighteſt of all, and according to its fatneſs; it is the moſt free and apt to produce the moſt of Vegetables you plant in it. Sandy-Lands are beſt improved by mixture of Chalk, Lime, Marle, the ſediments of Ponds, Lakes, or ſtanding Waters, and need a more conſtant ſupply of ſuch Additions than any other, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:100170:14"/> you have the command of ſome Spring or Stream of Water to irrigate it, and prevent the Suns exhaling the moiſture it ſo eaſily parts withal, for we may conſtantly obſerve in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Summers, what vaſt products Sandy-Land will afford us, compared with the dry. The ſame you will find in your <hi>Gardens,</hi> but the hot Dungs are here to be neglected, and the more cooling made uſe of.</p>
                           <p>The beſt for light Sandy-land, is Cow-dung, being cool and fat.</p>
                           <p>Some Plants delight in moiſt and boggy Lands, and where the Scituation of the <hi>Garden</hi> will not afford a Natural Bogg, an Artificial may be made, if you have the command of a Spring to feed it, or that you draw not wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter very deep to moiſten it often by hand; it may be made by digging a large Pit in ſuch place you think moſt convenient, where if the Earth be not tenacious enough to detain the moiſture required, you may line the bottom and ſides with Clay well temper'd and trodden down, and fill it with Earth taken from a Bogg; in which being duely watered by ſome ſmall current led thereto, or by frequent irrigations, your curious Aquaticks may be propagated as well as in the Natural.</p>
                           <p>There are ſeveral other ſorts of Land, that are known by ſeveral other Names, which I might here enumerate, but theſe being the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and moſt Lands falling under ſome or one of theſe capacities, I ſhall not trouble you with them here, brevity being my ſtudy.</p>

                           <p>The Round is very pleaſant, and ſome cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Gardens</hi> there are of that Form in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Parts. The Walls about ſuch a <hi>Garden</hi> are very good for Fruit, the Winds being not ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere againſt a round, as againſt a ſtreight Wall. The Walk alſo that circundates that <hi>Garden</hi> is not unpleaſant, for that you may walk as long as you pleaſe in it, always forwards without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhort turning; ſome ſtreight Walks there may be, that tend from the Circumſerence to the Centre. The ſeveral Quadrants may be ſub-divided and planted with Fruits; the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the round Walk, and the croſs Walks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſufficient for Flowers and Plants of Beauty and Delight. At the Centre of this <hi>Garden,</hi> may be placed a Fountain, or in defect of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Banquetting Houſe, or Houſe of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                           <p>A rude Draught of ſuch a Form is here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to your View, the outermoſt Walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing adorned with Cypreſs Trees, the inner parts of the Graſs-Plats with Firr-Trees, and the Quadrants within the leſſer Circle, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with variety of Fruit-Trees, and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Walks round and ſtreight, bordered with Flowers and delightful Shrubs and Plants.</p>

                           <p>The Square is the moſt perfect and pleaſant Form that you can lay your <hi>Garden</hi> into, where your Ground will afford it; every Walk that is in it being ſtreight, and every Plant and Tree ſtanding in a direct Line, repreſents it to your Eye very pleaſing. The delight you take in walking in it, being much the more as you are leſs careful: For when you walk in a Round or Circle, you are more ſubject to treſpaſs on the Borders, without continual Thoughts and Obſervation of your Ground.</p>

                           <p>The other two parts, you may convert the one of them into an Orchard, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into a Kitchin-Garden, which will be no ſmall Advantage or Ornament to your Seat, and middle <hi>Garden</hi> of Pleaſure.</p>
                           <p>But if you are willing to celebrate ſo fair a ſpot of Ground, as the whole Square, to the delights of <hi>Flora;</hi> then may you divide it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to larger Squares, and Graſs-plots, leaving on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Borders on their confines for your variety of Plants.</p>
                           <p>The new mode of Gravel-walks and Graſs-plots, is fit only for ſuch Houſes or Palaces, that are ſcituated near Cities, and great Towns, although they are now become Preſidents for many ſtately Country Reſidencies, where they have baniſh'd out of their <hi>Gardens</hi> Flowers, the Miracles of Nature, and the beſt Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that ever were diſcovered to make a Seat pleaſant. But 'tis hoped that this new, uſeleſs, and unpleaſant Mode, will like many other Vanities grow out of Faſhion.</p>
                           <p>A Draught of the Square <hi>Garden</hi> I have here given you, which may be varied as every De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigner pleaſeth; each principal Walk is border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Flowers; each principal Corner with Flower-pots, and the middles of the greater Squares with Statues. The farther end fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with a Palliſade, that the proſpect of the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100170:19"/> adjacent Orchard may not be loſt; where now the Statues ſtand, if Water be to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, Fountains would be placed with more delight.</p>
                           <p>The infinite variety of Forms that might be drawn and here repreſented to you, would but encreaſe your Charge; when perhaps e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Builder may better pleaſe himſelf in the ſhape and contrivance of his <hi>Garden,</hi> than any other can do for him.</p>
                           <p>But theſe few Rules are not amiſs to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, <hi>viz.</hi> That you endeavour to make the principal Entrance into your <hi>Garden,</hi> out of the beſt Room in your Houſe, or very near it, your Walks being places of Divertiſement after a ſedentary repaſt. The Aromatick O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, they yield pleaſant Refreſhments after a groſs Diet; ſuch innocent Exerciſes being the beſt digeſtive to weak Stomachs.

                           </p>
                           <p>If your Ground you intend for a <hi>Garden,</hi> lye on the ſide of a Hill, your Walks may be made the one above the other, and be as Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>races the one to the other; the declining ſides of them, being either of Graſs alone, or plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with Fruit.</p>

                           <p>Theſe Walls are very kind to Fruits, under which they bear abundantly: The Nieches and Pillaſters conduce very much to the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off the cold Winds, and ſhelter the Fruit from them.</p>
                           <p>Next unto the Brick, Stone-Walls are prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <note place="margin">2. <hi>Of Stone-Walls.</hi>
                              </note> the ſquare hewn Stone out of the Quarry, eſpecially Sand or Free-ſtone is the beſt, the cold white Stone like unto Chalk, or Lime-ſtone is not ſo good.

                           <p> All Stone Walls muſt be well coped, left wet inſinuates it ſelf between the Stones, and decay it in a little time. A coping of Tyle is the beſt, if made to carry off the drip 3 or 4 inches from the Wall.</p>

                              </note> Brick ſcarce, and Lime and Sand not near, Walls are often made by a Compoſt of Earth, and Straw tempered with it. This Earth muſt be either of a clayiſh nature, or have a little mixture of Clay in it; it muſt be well wrought and mixed with long Dung or Straw, which ſerves to hold it together until it be throughly dry; and then according to the skill of the Workman, wrought up into a Wall, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Thatch, being not able to bear a more weighty coping.</p>
                           <p>Theſe Walls well wrought, and well coped and preſerved dry, will laſt many years, and very warm and kind to Fruits, that is, to ſuch that are content to be humble, theſe Walls being rarely built high.</p>
                           <p>In the building theſe Walls, pieces of wood, or hooks of Iron ought to be placed in, at convenient diſtances, ſtanding three or four inches without the Wall, to which Poles or Rails are to be faſtned, and to them your Fruit-trees, there being no tacking Trees to the Wall it ſelf.</p>
                           <p>This way of Fencing is much uſed in ſome parts, and ſomewhat reſembles the <hi>French</hi> way of making Walls for Fruit; for what-ever they are made of they are plaſtered over, and hooks
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100170:21"/> of Iron or Sheeps ſhank-bones placed in the building of the Wall, at ſome convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to affix the Poles unto, as in the ſmall <hi>French</hi> piece called the <hi>Planters Manual,</hi> adap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only for that Countrey, may be obſerved. Alſo <hi>Rapinus</hi> at large deſcribes the making of that Wall, and both of them preſcribe the plaiſtering of them, as well to deſtroy the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min that would otherwiſe ſhelter themſelves in the rotten cavities of thoſe Mud-Walls, as to accelerate the maturation of your Fruits.</p>
                           <p>So that here in <hi>England</hi> where other Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials are ſcarce, and ſuch a ſtiff Loam in the place, theſe Mud-walls may prove beneficial, not only for ſecurity, warmth, and privacy, but for the advancement and melioration of your Fruits, more eſpecially if Lime be not wanting to make a Plaiſter to cover it after that <hi>French</hi> mode.</p>
                           <p>It is not improbable that a mixture of Loam, Lime, Sand and Gravel, or ſmall Sand-ſtones, may by being raiſed between two Planks, and ſo by degrees to the height of a Wall, and then well defended by a light coping, make a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good and durable Fence and Shelter for your beſt Fruits.

                              </note> and beſt Fences for the outſides of your <hi>Garden,</hi> for privacy, ſecurity, and advantage to your Fruits. There are yet other neceſſary Fences, for the cantoning or dividing your <hi>Garden</hi> into leſſer parts for the ſeveral uſes you deſign them for, or for the ſecurity of ſome particular parts of your <hi>Garden,</hi> or Fruits, or Flowers, from the hands of every one that may otherwiſe have liberty or occaſion to walk there; yet not to impede or diminiſh
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100170:22"/> the pleaſure in viewing thoſe objects of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light thus defended.</p>
                           <p>Theſe open Fences are made of board of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three or four inches broad, and three or four foot long, either nailed to, or let tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row two Rails, with heads cut either round, or like a Lance, and painted white with Lin-ſeed Oyl, and white Lead, two or three times over, to make them endure the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                           <p>But the beſt material to make theſe Palli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades withal is Iron, ſo framed as are the Iron Balconies in <hi>London;</hi> ſave only that theſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear above the Rails with ſquare painted heads which ſeem moſt beautiful; by reaſon that Flowers and other delightſom Plants appear ſo plain through them. This Fence is alſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and needs no repair.</p>
                           <p>In imitation whereof, there is newly made in ſome few <hi>Gardens</hi> a Palliſade of Boards, of about three or four inches broad; which as before were ſet flat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>wiſe, each place in the Palliſade, is now ſet edge-wiſe, the upper Rail running through each Pale, and the foot cut with an Ox Mouth, and ſet on an Arras Rail, either near the ground, or reſting on a ground-pinning of Brick. The head of each Pale is about three or four inches above the upper Rail, divided into two parts, the middle va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy being about one third part of the whole breadth, the two extream parts for about four or five inches, being cut with ſquare pyrami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical points, do very much reſemble thoſe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100170:22"/> made of Iron. As you ſtand againſt them they appear open, and every thing very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous through them like the Iron; but as you view them obliquely they appear full, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their ſharp heads more open and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant. Theſe Palliſades, although they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſomewhat more Timber and Workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip than the ordinary ſort, yet are by far the more compleat and beautiful, every motion of your Body from its place, begetting a variety in the object.</p>
                           <p>Theſe open Fences are much more pleaſant and uſeful in your Partirs and inward <hi>Gardens,</hi> than cloſe Walls; for theſe prevent not your view of the whole, nor hinder the free Air from your Plants, which is as neceſſary in ſome degree as warmth, which ought to be obtained from Shelters and Fences at a diſtance, not by too great a reverberation of heat, and ſtifling in the Summer for want of Air, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which proves fatal to moſt Flowers.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Gardens</hi> are oftentimes ſecur'd by quick Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, <note place="margin">6. <hi>Of Quick Fences.</hi>
                              </note> whereof the moſt eaſie to propagate is that of the white Thorn, which being well planted in double, treble, or more Cheſts or Rows of Plants, and kept weeded and defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for three or four years, will thrive very well in moſt ſorts of Land; and being kept clipp'd, ſheer'd, or cut with a ſharp hook, will grow ſo thick that a Bird cannot find its way through, and from the ground to ſix it ſeven foot high, it will prove a very great ſecurity againſt bad Weather, evil Neighbors,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:100170:23"/> and Cattle; but is a ſhelter for Snails, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Vermin that will conſtantly annoy your beſt Plants, and are not therefore to be plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near your Partir, wherein you plant your beſt Flowers.</p>
                           <p>A Quick Hedge of Holly is the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, and moſt compact of any; but the tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of its growth is enough to diſcourage any man from attempting its propagation, its Seed being two years before they appear above the ground, and its Plants long before they let you know of their like or diſlike of the Soil.</p>

                        <p>IT is not the leaſt part of the pleaſures of a <hi>Garden,</hi> to walk and refreſh your ſelf either with your Friends or Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or elſe alone retired from the cares of the World, or apart from Company that ſometimes may prove burthenſom to you, and when your own Laſſitude, or the Heat, Rain, or ſcorching beams of the Sun, render the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen Walks unpleaſant, to repoſe your ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome pleaſant Tree, or in ſome Covert or Shade, until you are willing to try the Air again.</p>

                           <p>WHerefore to accommodate you for all <note place="margin">1. <hi>Stone-Walks.</hi>
                              </note> Seaſons wet or dry, hot or cold, it is convenient to have Walks and Places of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in your <hi>Garden.</hi> As for Walks, the beſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:100170:24"/> for the Winter and wet Seaſons are thoſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with Stone, about the breadth of five foot, in the midſt of a Gravel-walk, of about five or ſix foot Gravel on each ſide the Stone, or of Graſs, which you pleaſe, for on theſe flat Stones may you walk ſecurely under-foot in all Weathers, without prejudice to your ſelf or Walks.</p>
                           <p>Next unto the paved Stone are the Gravel-walks <note place="margin">2. <hi>Gravel Walks.</hi>
                              </note> walks to be preferred, which if made with a fine skreened red Gravel, do very much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn your <hi>Garden;</hi> and being laid round, and kept rolled with a Stone-roler, caſt off the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and are very uſeful in moiſt Weather to walk on.</p>
                           <p>The Gravel-walks are beſt under your Fruit-walks, becauſe the beams or rays of the Sun re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect from them againſt the Walls, much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than from Graſs, and very much advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage your Fruit.</p>
                           <p>The great inconveniences theſe Walks are ſubject unto, are Weeds and Moiſture: To prevent the Weeds, you muſt be ſure to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all manner of earth clean from the place before you bring in your Gravel; and in caſe the Earth be not ſtiff enough of it ſelf, it would not be amiſs to ſupport the ſides with two or three courſes of Brick, or at leaſt a Brick ſet on end edge by edge, to prevent the falling in, or mixture of the ſaid Earth with your Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel; yet ſo that the upper part of your Brick may be an inch beneath the ſurface of your Walk, that it may not be diſcerned. If your
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:100170:24"/> Ground be good and apt to run to Weeds, ſeven or eight inches deep ought your Gravel to lie, leſt the Weeds find their way through: you ought alſo to cleanſe the Ground under, from the Roots of Graſs, Weeds, as Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, Docks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> leaſt they find their way through the Gravel. You may fill your Walk with ordinary coarſe unskreened Gravel five or ſix inches, and after that is levelled, then lay on your laſt Courſe of fine Gravel, and roll it well: if your upper Courſe of Gravel be two or three inches thick, and at any time your Walk grow diſcoloured or moſſy, you may ſtir it with a Spade as far as the fine Gravel lyes, and finely rake it, then roll it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and it will appear to be as freſh as at the firſt.</p>
                           <p>The other inconvenience theſe Walks are ſubject unto is Moiſture, eſpecially after a Froſt, which very much looſens the Gravel, and long ſoaking Rains make it apt to ſtick to your Feet: For the beſt red Gravel hath a mixture of Clay or Loam in it, which makes it in dry weather bind the better; to prevent which, ſeveral Expedients are lately made uſe of: Some do grind or beat ſmall the ſhels of Fiſh gathered on the Sea-ſhore, and therewith add a thin coat on the Gravel, which by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant rolling incorporates with it, and is not apt to adhere to your Shooes, as is the Gravel it ſelf. Others that live near to Brick-kilns, make uſe of the refuſe parts of Bricks that are under burnt, which will eaſily pulverize, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:100170:25"/> lay that on the Gravel-Walks, which prevents the ſame inconvenience, and adds much to the beauty of your Walk, and is eaſily renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as there is occaſion.</p>
                           <p>On the edge of your Gravel-Walks, you may lay on each ſide a narrow Walk of Turf for your uſe in hot weather; or when you are willing to favour your Feet or your Gravel, which being kept out ſtrait on the edges, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies your Gravel.</p>
                           <p>But if you will have your Walk only Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, then will it be neceſſary to edge it with Brick three or four inches above the ſurface to prevent Earth or Rubbiſh from intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it; Bricks ſet on one end ſide by ſide, is the ſecureſt and moſt laſting way for this purpoſe.</p>
                           <p>Walks of Graſs are very pleaſant, and much <note place="margin">3. <hi>Green Walks.</hi>
                              </note> to be preferred in the Summer to any of the other, being cold and eaſie to the Feet. They are either made by laying them with Turf, or by raking them fine, and ſowing them with Hay-duſt or Seed (which may be had at the bottom of a Hay-mow or Rick) and well rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and weeded from all groſs Weeds, will ſoon become a fine Graſs-walk; if theſe Walks alſo be laid a little rounding, they will caſt off the water the better, and be more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for your uſe than if flat.</p>
                           <p>A Water-table on each ſide, of two or three inches deep, cut every year anew, not only receives the waſte water, but preſerves the Graſs or Weeds from mixing with your Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100170:25"/> and preſents your Walk much more pleaſant to your eye, than if it were other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
                           <p>To deſtroy Weeds in the Gravel-walks, or paved Walks, where you cannot convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eradicate them, you muſt water it with very ſalt Water, or with the Liquor they have at the Salters, which they call <hi>Bittern,</hi> which abſolutely deſtroys all Vegetation, where it is caſt in an indifferent good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity.</p>
                           <p>It is none of the leaſt oblectations a <hi>Garden</hi>

                           <p>They are uſually made where much Earth or Rubbiſh is to ſpare, which would coſt time and labour to remove; and here is diſpoſed of to advantage, with the only expence of a Wall on the out-ſide to ſupport it; or if you pleaſe on both; but the inner-ſide to your <hi>Garden</hi> may be made declining, and cloathed with Turf.

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100170:27"/> another, as the weather happens. This Seat may be made cloſe behind, and covered, that being ſet with the back to the Wind, will be both warm and dry.</p>
                           <p>In the Nieches of your Wall may you place Seats covered over, that you may reſt your ſelf in at your pleaſure: At the ends of your Walks are the moſt proper places for ſuch Seats, that whilſt you ſit in either of them, you have the view of your Garden.</p>
                           <p>The beſt Form for theſe Seats is round, the one ſemicircle within the Wall, the other with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with a <hi>Cupulo,</hi> the outward part to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by three or four, or more columns of Timber or Stone, the other part reſting on the Wall, the top covered with Lead, Slate or Shingle, with its due Corniſh about that part that is off from the Wall.</p>
                           <p>Or you may make them of a long ſquare Form, about two Foot in the Niech of the Wall, and as much without, covered as the round, but caſting the drip ſide-ways or back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                           <p>Having ſeveral of theſe Seats facing to each Coaſt, be the Wind or Sun either way, you have a place to defend your ſelf from it.</p>
                           <p>You may alſo cover your Benches or Stools with Mat, and lay the Floors with Board, which will much conduce to your own eaſe and health.</p>
                           <p>Arbors, Benches, and Seats are very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <note place="margin">3 <hi>Of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure-houſes.</hi>

                           <p>This ſmall Edifice, uſually term'd a Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure-houſe or Banquetting-houſe may be made at ſome remote Angle of your Garden: For the more remote it is from your Houſe, the more private will you be from the frequent diſturbances of your Family or Acquaintance, and being made at an Angle, part within your <hi>Garden,</hi> and part without, you will have the priveledges and advantages of Air and View, which otherwiſe you will want, and which render it much more pleaſant than to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.</p>
                           <p>The Windows and Doors, the one or other reſpecting every Coaſt, may be glazed with the beſt and moſt tranſparent Glaſs, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent every Object through it the more ſplendid, with skreens of painted and printed Sarcenet, to prevent in the day, and ſhutters of thin Wainſcot in the night, others from diſturbing your ſolitary Repoſe.</p>
                           <p>Alſo you may reap the pleaſure and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Air from either Coaſt, by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſide of your ſmall Edifice, from whence you would receive it, excluding on the other ſide that which might otherwiſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy you.</p>

                           <p>On theſe ſmall Edifices may you beſtow what coſt you can afford, and make them (as they deſerve to be) the principal Ornaments of your Ville.</p>

                           <p>MAny pleaſant Seats, Vills, and <hi>Gardens</hi> there are, that are very well ſcituate for Air and Proſpect, that are of themſelves dry, which defect may be ſupplied from Springs of Water riſing at ſome diſtance, and may be conveyed by Pipes to ſuch places in your Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le, or <hi>Garden</hi> as you deſire.</p>
                           <p>In places where Wood is plenty, the Elm is <note place="margin">Of Pipes for Water.</note> the moſt proper material to make Pipes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, for the conveyance of water from the Spring to your <hi>Garden,</hi> not being ſubject to be torn by Froſt, as are the leaden or earthen Pipes, either of which you muſt be ſure to lay deep enough below the ſurface of the Earth, that the Froſt may not reach them.</p>
                           <p>Leaden Pipes are the moſt convenient where water is to be raiſed to any conſiderable height, being not apt to grow leaky, nor to decay; but you muſt be ſure to lay them deep in Clay as you can; but not in any mixture of Lime, or ſuch like, left it decay the Metal: alſo you muſt have a Turn-cock at the loweſt part of your Pipe, where muſt be a paſſage, that out of it you may let the water at the beginning of a Froſt, to prevent the Pipes from break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                           <pb n="39" facs="tcp:100170:29"/>
                           <p> Earthen Pipes may be made of about three foot in length, and made to fit the one into the other; and as they are laid deep in a ſoft Bed of Earth, Clay, or Sand, the joynts may be cloſed with a cement of Quick-lime, Linſeed-oyl, and Cotten-wool, and bound a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the joynt with a piece of Leather, and a turn or two of Pack-thread: But theſe Pipes are not for forcing the water to any height, being apt to break, but are very neceſſary, cheap and ſweet for the conveyance of any Spring without force, to the place you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire.</p>
                           <p>Sometimes it happens that Springs lye con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in the Earth, which may, if diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, prove very uſeful in your Ville, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant in your <hi>Garden,</hi> which to diſcover, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Precepts of <hi>Rapinus:</hi>

                           <p>Theſe if they lie above or level with your <hi>Garden,</hi> may be brought by Pipes into it; but if they happen to lie below it, then muſt you

                           <p>Where ſuch a Stream or Rivulet cannot na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally glide through your <hi>Garden,</hi> but near unto it, it's probable that part of it may be raiſed by ſome Machine, at ſome diſtance from your <hi>Garden,</hi> and by an Aquaeduct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed through it, which will be more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious (the charge only excepted in the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it thither) than the natural Current. 1.

In the upper compartment are shown: a fountain raising a single ball (or dome) of water; a fountain raising a double ball (or domes) of water; a dragon-shaped fountain; and a crown-shaped fountain. In the middle compartment are shown: a statue of a woman with water fountaining out of one of her nipples (into the face of a lady walking nearby with a gentleman); and a fountain shaped like an oak tree. In the lower compartment is shown a musical fountain which operates a water-organ. Engraved by Frederick Hendrick van Hoave (1628?-1698).</figDesc>

                           </q>
                           <p>Therefore the Water muſt be conveyed from ſome Ciſtern or Conduit, ſtanding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove your <hi>Garden,</hi> at ſome diſtance by Pipes, or elſe it muſt by ſome Artifice be raiſed into a Ciſtern of Lead over ſome Lodge or <hi>Grot</hi> in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100170:34"/> your <hi>Garden,</hi> that from thence it may by ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler Pipes be ſecretly conveyed to your ſeveral Works.</p>
                           <p>As to the <hi>Fountains</hi> where it may be caſt through various Figures, as before was hinted in the laſt Section.</p>
                           <p>Or it may be made to riſe in the midſt of a <hi>Fountain</hi> or your Grotto, through the Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of an Artificial Tree, each Sprig being hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that it may continually drop with Spouts on the top, for the erecting of greater quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Water.</p>
                           <p>Or it may riſe in one ſmall upright Stream, carrying a Ball of Wood on it, which being exactly round, and placed on the mouth of the Pipe, and the Water by the opening of a ſtop cock made for that purpoſe, admitted by degrees; the Ball will riſe and be ſupported by the Spout of Water, to five, ſix, or ſeven foot high, after the ſame manner as a ſingle Peaſe may be elevated by your Breath on a Straw; but in caſe your Ball be apt to fall, then may you perforate it through the Centre ſmoothly and exactly in the middle, and place this ſmall hole directly on the middle of the mouth of the Pipe, and ſo raiſe the Ball by degrees, and the ſmall ſpout of water that paſſes through the Centre of the Ball will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it in its due poſture.</p>
                           <p>By a <hi>Copper Cylinder</hi> made to fit on the top of the Pipe, out of which the water violently flows, to take off and on at pleaſure, may you ſometimes make the water reſemble a large
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100170:35"/> Glaſs inverted, by placing a flat piece of Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per on the top of the <hi>Cylinder,</hi> and leaving on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a narrow circular paſſage under it, for the water freely to flow out of it on every ſide. Another Pipe or <hi>Cylinder</hi> of a leſſer ſize, made to riſe off the middle of the ſaid flat piece of Copper or Cap, with a like Cap on the top of it, and a paſſage left as before, will cauſe the water iſſuing out of both the <hi>Cylinders</hi> the one over the other, to preſent a Glaſs within a Glaſs, both inverted.</p>
                           <p>Alſo <hi>Crowns, Birds, Beaſts,</hi> made of light Braſs or Copper, hollow and eaſie to turn on a <hi>Cylinder,</hi> the one end of the <hi>Cylinder</hi> is to be ſet on the top of the Water-pipe, the other end to force the water with certain thin Vanes in the inſide of your hollow Figure, which will make it to move ſwiftly about, ejecting the water out of the ſides or mouth of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures in its motion, which is very pleaſant to behold.</p>
                           <p>Secret Pipes may be under the Ground, the ends not appearing above it, that when any Ladies unawares, or caſually walk or ſtand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, by the turning of a ſtop cock, you may force the water upright under their Coats, to their ſudden ſurprize.</p>
                           <p>You may alſo place on Pedeſtals of about three foot high, ſeveral Figures at about three foot diſtance, ten or twenty of a ſide: The interval between theſe Figures may be 8 or 10 foot over. Through theſe Pedeſtals and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures ſmall Pipes muſt be brought, that the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100170:35"/> Water may out of the mouth of the Figures be ejected into the Air; the one Figure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting it towards its oppoſite Figure beyond it, and a little ſideways, ſo that at the turning of a ſtop-cock, each Figure ſhall caſt out a ſtream of Water over like a Rain-bow, that you may walk under theſe Spouts, as under ſo many Arches, without any drop falling on you.</p>
                           <p>But that which is very delightful, is the ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Nightingal, exactly imitated by the motion of the Water, and is thus performed: In ſome Cavity of your Grott or other Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice where you deſire at any time to hear this Muſick you muſt place a large Ciſtern of Lead, containing ten, twenty, or thirty Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons as you pleaſe: This Ciſtern muſt be well clothed on every part (except the uſeful paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages for Pipes) into it: near the top muſt the Water be let in freely through a Pipe of about an inch diameter; then you muſt have alſo near the top, two, three, or four ſmall Pipes iſſuing out, tending a little downwards, at the end of which you muſt fix your Pipes made of Braſs, or other Metal, made before you fix them like an ordinary <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> wherewith Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren exerciſe themſelves in their paſtimes, ſo that when you try it with your Breath, and hold the lower end in Water, it ſhall Pipe and chuck as the Nightingal ſometimes both; you may make two, three, or four of theſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſizes, the biggeſt not large, and they will give ſome diſtinction in ſound, theſe being
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100170:36"/> fixed to the ends of the ſmall Pipes iſſuing out of your Ciſtern, and the lower ends of them dipping into a Trough of Lead, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the bottom of the Ciſtern; when by the turning of a ſtop-cock, the Water flows into the Ciſtern, it expelleth the Air through theſe Pipes, which give you your deſired Muſick, until your Ciſtern be full, then muſt you ſtop the cock, that the Ciſtern may empty it ſelf again, and be ready for another time.</p>
                           <p>The Pipe through which it empties its ſelf, may be at the bottom of the Ciſtern, of about the diameter of one third part of an inch, ſo that the Pipe that ſupplies the Ciſtern with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, muſt of neceſſity be of Capacity ſufficient to afford Water enough for this under Pipe, and to enforce Air for the muſical Pipes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this emptying Pipe you may leſſen as you find occaſion.</p>
                           <p>The Water that runs through this lower Pipe, may deſcend into the Trough that is under the muſical Pipes, to ſupply that with Water.</p>
                           <p>Inſtead of this lower Pipe, you may have a Siphon made in your Ciſtern, the inner foot of it to reach the bottom of the inſide, the neck thereof to be near to the top of it, but not altogether ſo high, the outer foot of it ſomewhat lower than the bottom, that when the Water flows into the Ciſtern, and ſtops the inner foot of the Siphon, the Air forthwith gives you your Muſick until the Ciſtern be full, then of its ſelf the Water paſſes through
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100170:36"/> the Siphon until the Ciſtern be empty. In this way, leſs Water will make your Muſick, becauſe there is no decreaſe of it until the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern be filled, but then you muſt not deſiſt until it be full, elſe it will not flow out of the Siphon. You muſt alſo ſupply the Through before your muſical Pipes with Water from ſome other Pipe, therefore the former way is the more facile.</p>
                           <p>By this means may you make many Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Artificial Sounds, and to continue in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion according to the quantity of your Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and capacity of your Ciſtern; the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that flows in waſt from it, being made to fall from one precipice to another, which with its murmering Noiſe intermixed with the Muſical Pipes, makes an excellent charming Harmony, eſpecially none of it being in view, but concealed in Rock-work made for that purpoſe.</p>

                           <p>IT oftentimes happens that in theſe <hi>Northern Climes,</hi> the <hi>Aeſtival</hi> heats are more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome than they are nearer the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> the Sun continuing here longer above the <hi>Horizon</hi> in the Summer ſeaſon, than in thoſe parts, which occaſions that intemperancy that many times
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100170:37"/> we are ſenſible of; for as we have leſs of the preſence of the Sun in the Winter, ſo have we that defect ſupplied in the Summer.</p>
                           <p>But thoſe that inhabit more <hi>Southerly,</hi> and have the Sun more perpendicularly over them, are more ſenſible of the acute heat of that bright Orb about the middle of the day, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally than we are; and therefore about the heat of the day, they uſually ſequeſter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from their ordinary Occupations, and betake themſelves to their ſhades and cool pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Receſs for ſome few hours.</p>
                           <p>Such that have convenient places in their Villes, make themſelves <hi>Grotto's</hi> or Caves in the Earth for that only purpoſe, on which ſome have beſtowed ſo much Coſt and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, that thoſe Grotts have been the Object of Admiration of, and part of the Subject of ſeveral Hiſtories written by ſeveral Travellers and Strangers, as are their Baths and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
                           <p>For the ſame reaſon may our Grotts be as neceſſary for us, to repoſe our ſelves in the time of our Summer faint Heats, although they are not here ſo conſtant every year as in thoſe parts, yet are they leſs tolerable, for want of theſe nocturnal breezes they uſually enjoy.</p>
                           <p>Therefore either in the ſide of ſome declive of a Hill, or under ſome Mount or Terrace artificially raiſed may you make a place of repoſe, cool and freſh in the greateſt heats. It may be arched over with Stone or Brick, and you may give it what light or entrance you
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100170:37"/> pleaſe. You may make ſecret Rooms and Paſſages within it, and in the outer Room may you have all thoſe before mentioned Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-works, for your own or your Friends di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements.</p>
                           <p>It is a place that is capable of giving you ſo much pleaſure and delight, that you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow not undeſervedly what coſt you pleaſe on it, by paving it with Marble, or immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it with Stone, or Rock-work, either na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or artificially reſembling the Excellencies of Nature.

                        <p>Statues are commendable in the midſt of Fountains, and green Squares in Groves, and at the end of obſcure Walks.</p>

                        <p>Many Dials of various and curious Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip are made, and may be placed on Pedeſtals in the midſt of the Squares inſtead of Statues, which better become the ſhades.</p>

                              </note> in our <hi>European</hi> parts, none have yet merited that eſteem as the <hi>Cypreſs</hi> hath done, it being the moſt uniform, ſtreighteſt, and moſt ſlender of any other, preſerving its Verdure throughout the year.</p>
                           <p>Its natural Country is <hi>Candia,</hi> where (as <hi>Pliny</hi> writes) if a man plow the ground, and not ſow it with ſome other thing, <hi>Cypreſſes</hi> will come up, and preſently ſhew above ground; from whence they have been ſpread into the moſt parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſo far as the extream cold will give them leave.</p>
                           <p>Their Seed ſeldom or never ripens here in <hi>England;</hi> but ſuch as you have from foreign parts, you muſt ſow about the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> which when come up and carefully wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and weeded, you may remove.</p>
                           <p>Theſe Trees may be either planted as Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards, or in Hedges, and clipped as other tonſile Hedges uſually are: if you intend them for Standards, at about three or four years the middle ſhoot ought to be cut off near the top, aad the whole Tree cut into a pyramidical Form, and not bound as is the uſual cuſtom, only clip them, not late in the year, left

                           <p>For if they are not cloſe bound but clipt and ſtand not in a cold moiſt Ground, they will endure the hardeſt Froſts, and ſharpeſt Winds: For I have known many that ſtood in the loweſt part of the <hi>Garden</hi> killed with the extremity of cold, when others that ſtood on a Terrace, more obvious to the cold Winds eſcaped; and for no other reaſon, as I could judge, but their dry and healthy Soil they grew in.</p>

                           <p>It is one of the beſt ornamental Trees you can plant either for beauty or ſhade, it will cloath your moſt ſhady Walls, and will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the moſt ſcorching beames of the Sun, it will mount to twenty or thirty foot in height, and be content to be humble and tonſil, no Weather will annoy it, it delights moſt in moiſt Ground.</p>

                           <p>There are two ſorts of it, the one with a ſmaller and more edged Leaf than the other, which yields great plenty of Bloſſoms in the Winter, and laſts until the Spring, which Bloſſoms are of a ſtrong Scent, by reaſon of a gummy Matter adhering to them, which the Bees wonderfully affect, which blooming Trees, if there were many of them near your Apiary, they would very much help your Bees, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much of other Food was to be found by them in the Spring; but the barren Tree is the more beautiful.</p>
                           <p>Theſe Trees may be cut into any form high or low, in Hedges or in ſingle Trees, and will cover a Seat or Bower in a ſhort time, and more neatly than any Tree whatſoever.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100170:44"/> muſt they give place to the moſt beautifull of Trees and Shrubs of the ſame kind (as to their durableneſs) by reaſon of their variegations, much excelling thoſe that are of a plain co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour.</p>
                           <p>For what can be more pleaſant than to have Groves or Walks (when the Flowers that are but for a day are retired) apparalled with gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed party-colour Garments, ſome with yellow and green, others with white and green, emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the two royal Metals, that by the Gilder's hand adorn the Palaces of Princes.

                              </note> whoſe Bark as well as Leaf, is variegated with a bright yellow; the more yellow the Leaf is, the more beautifull is the Plant; ſome are ſtrip'd throughout the Barks and Berries: If vulgar green <hi>Holly</hi> be ſo glorious and refreſhing an Object, as Mr. <hi>Evelin</hi> hath Characterized it to be, then certainly the ſame with a due mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a bright yellow muſt pre-excell. In fine, whoſoever hath once ſeen this Tree, will not think any perennial Green equal to it, for it is like the true Scarlet-dy which preſent, debaſeth all other Colours.</p>

                              <hi>Garden</hi> Ground is moſt prone to Weeds, which are its Spontaneous productions, and ſeeing that Weeds are expected in our <hi>Grove,</hi> as well as in our <hi>Garden,</hi> it were better that it were in part ſupplied for want of gilded leaved Flowers with gilded Weeds, whereof the <hi>Night-ſhade,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a noiſome Weed, but with its variegated Leaves, and here and there thinly diſperſed, and gilded <hi>Mugwort,</hi> another Weed of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, would make a good mixture with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther richer Dyes, like the ordinary Colours in a Picture, which ſerve to illuſtrate the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent.</p>

                              </note> probably be; but theſe are all that I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto obſerved. As theſe have been caſually met withal, and from them others have been raiſed, ſo by the ſame reaſon may other ſorts be diſcovered, that yet have not been obſerved.</p>

                           <p> For travelling through ſome part of <hi>Glamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganſhire,</hi> and diſcourſing of theſe variegated Greens, one of that Country aſſured me, that in that Country was a very large <hi>Holly</hi> with all its Leaves curiouſly gilded, growing wild in a Wood, which was not unlikely, for from the Woods they firſt came, but that which was moſt ſtrange, was, that the ſame Tree ſhould be neglected, and not a great number of Plants raiſed from it.</p>
                           <p>The Reaſons why ſuch variety of Colours ſhould appear in the Leaves of Trees and Plants, are not eaſily diſcovered, ſeeing that we may obſerve the like in the various Colours of ſome ſorts of Beaſts and Birds, whereof no account has been yet given; and they as well as theſe are alſo apt to degenerate. But the reaſon of ſuch a variegation of Colours may be ſuppoſed to be a Defect in Nature, becauſe the more ſterile the Land is wherein they grow, the better are their Colours preſerved, and the more rich the Ground is, the ſooner do they degenerate. And as theſe curious Plants are by accident, or ſome ſecret inclination of Nature undiſcovered unto us, ſo they are the more to be valued, and on them may we the better beſtow our delight and admiration.</p>

                           <p>Theſe gilded party-colour'd Branches, would well have became thoſe Crowns and Garlands ſo frequently uſed by the Ancients, had they been then known, and might (ſome of them at leaſt) have been incerted in Dr. <hi>Brown</hi>'s Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of Coronary Plants.</p>

The moſt principal of which is the <hi>Platanus,</hi> a Tree ſo much admired by the ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> that they preferred them before any of their own Native Productions, and that for their Shades only, it ſo abſolutely
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100170:47"/> excluding the Beams of the Sun in the Summer, and admitting them in the Winter. The Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are but thin and ſlender, the Leaves broad, and of colour pleaſant, the Tree groweth large. <hi>Pliny</hi> records that in his time, a <hi>Plane-Tree</hi> was of that bigneſs, that being hollow within, eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen perſons uſually ſat on Benches in it, and ſupp'd with <hi>Licinius Mutianus</hi> its owner.

                           <p>The <hi>Box,</hi> the greater <hi>Tree-ſtone Crop, Arbor Vitae, Savin, Platanus,</hi> and the <hi>Paliurus,</hi> are increaſed by Slips and Layers only, which muſt be laid or ſlipped in the Spring, and (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the <hi>Paliurus)</hi> may be removed all the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the <hi>Paliurus</hi> only in the Spring.</p>
                           <p>It is obſerved, that it is the beſt way of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Box,</hi> to ſtrip away the Leaves from the Slip, and not to wind the Stem, but to ſet it whole without winding.</p>
                           <p>It is alſo ſaid, that every Slip of a <hi>Bay-Tree</hi> will grow, if ſet in <hi>March,</hi> the great Leaves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtript off, but they muſt be ſhaded, and ſometimes watred if need require, elſe they will not ſo eaſily take root.</p>
                           <p>The gilded Trees or Plants muſt be increaſed by Layers, Slips, or Graffs, for it is obſerved, that by raiſing them from Seed they degenerate, by reaſon that the Hawes or Seeds of the white Thorn come not up the next year after they are ſown: It will be ſomewhat tedious for ſuch as delight in Curioſities, to wait for the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the <hi>Glaſtenbury-Thorn</hi> from the Seed; therefore the beſt and moſt expeditious way of raiſing this Rarity, is by grafting it on a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon white Thorn.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Holly-Berry</hi> continues the like time in the ground before it ſprings, but the Berries clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of their mucilage before they are planted, very much accelerates their ſpringing: The Berries of the <hi>Eugh</hi> require the ſame ordering.</p>

                           <p> The <hi>Juniper</hi> Trees are propugated, either by Plants taken from the Woods, or by their Seeds or Berries, which will ſoon come up.</p>

                           <p>The more excellent ſorts of them have ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded very well by grafting on the Stock of the common <hi>Sweet-Briar.</hi>

                           <p> And when you have thus obtained one Tree of a ſort of the more Rare, you may multiply them by laying them, which may be done without the help of Boxes or Pots, the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches being pliable, and the Tree it ſelf humble, only by bending down the Tree, and laying the Branches in the Earth, and covering the middle of them, being firſt prickt with an Awl about ſome joynt, that is to be under the Earth. This may be done in the Spring, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times watring the Layers in dry Weather, then in the Autumn moſt of the Sprigs will have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken root, and are in their prime to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; theſe will never degenerate, and all Cions proceeding from them, will be of the ſame.</p>
                           <p>To make <hi>Roſes</hi> bear early, they muſt be planted in a very warm place, or on a decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Bank towards the Sun, and irrigated with Water, enriched with the hotteſt Dungs or Shavings of Horn and Lime ſteeped in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Some ſay warm Water will accelerate their blowing.</p>
                           <p>To make them bear late, the way approved of by ſeveral upon Experience, is at the time when they begin to bud, to clip or ſhear off all the Buds, and when other <hi>Roſes</hi> have done blowing, theſe will ſhoot forth new Buds; thus may you annually continue this pleaſant Flower longer than naturally it would, by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome of your Trees, that they may ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the other.</p>

                           <p>To have <hi>Roſes</hi> until <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> you may plant the monthly Roſe in ſome Niech of your South-wall, and you will have Roſe-buds freſh and fair in <hi>October,</hi> and in mild Winters in <hi>November,</hi> which by Shutters artificially made, may be defended from the Cold (ſometimes admitting the Sun) until <hi>Christmas,</hi> you may add artificial warmth to them if you pleaſe: I have had fair <hi>Roſes-buds</hi> in <hi>November,</hi> with younger by them, which might have been thus preſerved.</p>

Nor is it all the words I can invent, can convince you of the beauty of theſe Glories of Nature, but muſt refer you to the choice your ſelf, or Friend for you, can make out of that Magazine of Varieties that are collected by the ingenious Floriſts.</p>
                           <pb n="93" facs="tcp:100170:57"/>
                           <p> Their Colours are various, from the deepeſt dye of any other Flowers to the pureſt White, intermixt with the brighteſt Yellow, tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Scarlet, grave Purple, and many other compounds of theſe inclining to the Blew and Green.</p>
                           <p>Many double <hi>Tulips</hi> are now raiſed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there is ſome variety.</p>
                           <p>Their Seaſon of blowing continues long, the <hi>Praecoces</hi> or <hi>early Tulips,</hi> beginning ſome of them to blow at the Vernal Aequinox, the <hi>Medias</hi> which are the prime, continue all <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril,</hi> and ſometimes the half of <hi>May,</hi> till the end whereof the <hi>Serotines</hi> or late flowring <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi> continue.</p>
                           <p>When the principal of them diſplay their Colours in the heat of the day, there is not a more glorious ſight in Nature, nor is it to be imitated by Art, no Limner, nor Painter dares pretend to ſo great skill: But as all things elſe that are in exceſs are ſooneſt apt to decline, ſo theſe that exceed all others in beauty and lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre, ſooneſt fade; not any of them continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its Glory above eight or ten days, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the mildneſs of the Weather, or ſome arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial ſhade preſerve them; nor are they ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by any other from the ſame root.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Tulips</hi> are not only preſerved by taking them up yearly, when the ſtalks are turning yellow, or begin to be dry, but are by that means mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied and increaſed exceedingly. The uſual way is to take them up at that convenient time, and ſpread them thin on ſome board or
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:100170:58"/> floor until they are through dry, then cut off the ſtalks, and ſo let the roots lye in ſome box or boxes, or other convenient places until <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> or <hi>October,</hi> in a dry place, but not in the Sun or Wind; then ſeparate the main Bulbs from the leſſer Chives, taking all that are large (and round though ſmall) for Roots that will yield you Flowers the next year, and ſet them in the places appointed for them, but let the ground be digg'd or otherwiſe looſened, that the Root may the better dilate it ſelf and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, for in a narrow or ſtiff hole, your Root will remain till the next year as you left it.</p>
                           <p>It is not good to take them up after they have ſhot their Fibres or ſmall Sprigs, until after they have flower'd, leſt it hinders their flowring, and perhaps periſh them.</p>
                           <p>When you plant them, ſtick into the ground by them ſmall ſticks marked with the numeral Letters, which you may do <hi>ad infinitum,</hi> and in a ſmall Book for that purpoſe, may you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert the mark and name of the Flower.</p>
                           <p>When you take them up and diſperſe them into Boxes or other Receptacles, you may transfer the marks with them.</p>

But if your ground be naturally rich, or that your <hi>Tulips</hi> have grown ſeveral years in it, you may abate it, and ſupply it with that which is fit, or lay a bed of ſandy Earth about a finger thickneſs below the bulb, when it is in its proper place, that ſo the Fibres may receiv a check. <hi>Tulips</hi> may be raiſed in <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February</hi> on hot beds, but they muſt be the <hi>praecoces</hi> that are to flower early.</p>
                           <p>Some preſcribe to plant your <hi>Tulips</hi> in a natural Earth ſomewhat impoveriſhed with Sand, ſo that a little below the root the Earth may be better within reach of the Fibres.</p>
                           <p>If the ground be digg'd where your <hi>Tulips</hi> ſtood the laſt year, it is equal to a change of Mould, the Roots rarely falling into the ſame Earth again where they were before.</p>
                           <p>Your ſmall Cions or Off-ſets you may plant in a Bed by themſelves, which will furniſh you at another time with great variety</p>
                           <p>As <hi>Tulips</hi> run or degnerate, take them up and plant them in your outward Groves, your prime Colours will multiply faſt enough.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Tulips</hi> that are apt to decline towards a ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Colour, may be taken up a little before they come to flower, and laid in the Sun to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate

Theſe Seeds may be ſown in <hi>September,</hi> and every two years removed until they yield Bloſſoms; but this labour and patience are too great for an ingenious, and fit only for a dull <hi>Florist.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The often removing of the roots of <hi>Tulips</hi> and their Off-ſets into various ground, gives you a great encreaſe, and great variety of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, without that tedious way of raiſing them.</p>
                           <p>It is not good to let a <hi>Tulip</hi> ſtand too long after it hath blown, leſt by weakning the root it may prevent its blooming the next year.</p>

                           <p>The Bulbous afford very great variety, ſome of them (as the <hi>Perſian)</hi> flowering in <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> others in <hi>April, May, June,</hi> and <hi>July,</hi> There are ſome of them very fair and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; their Colours are either blue, purple, Aſh-coloured, peach-coloured, Yellow, White, or Variegated. Theire Roots may be taken
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:100170:63"/> up as ſoon as the Leaves begin to wither, for ſoon after they are quite withered, the Bulbs will iſſue out more Fibres, and then it is too late to remove them, otherwiſe you may keep them dry till <hi>Auguct.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>They delight in a good Ground, but not too rich, on a ſunny bank, but not too hot to the <hi>South</hi> or <hi>West;</hi> the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Aſpect is the beſt.</p>
                           <p>Thoſe <hi>Flower-de-Luces,</hi> white tuberous Roots, <note place="margin">Of the Tube-roſe Iris.</note> are not altogether ſo various as the Bulbous, yet affording to the ingenious Floriſt many curious Flowers; the beſt and moſt excellent whereof is the <hi>Chalcedonian Iris,</hi> vulgarly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Toad-Flag from its dark marbled Flower. This Species of them ought to be carefully ordered, elſe it will not thrive well, it requires a warm and rich Soil to be planted in, and becauſe it is apt to ſhoot forth its green Leaves before Winter, it expects to be a little defended from the Cold. Theſe Bulbs may be taken up when the Leaves begin to be dry, and kept ſome time in the Houſe, and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in <hi>September,</hi> or <hi>October,</hi> which will make them thrive the better.</p>
                           <p>The other ſorts of the <hi>Tuberoſe</hi> rooted <hi>Flower-de-Luces,</hi> are much more hardy, and increaſe exceedingly in good Ground, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not ſo fit for your choiceſt <hi>Garden.</hi>

                           <p>As of the <hi>Tulips,</hi> ſo of theſe, the beſt way is to pleaſe your ſelf in your Election from the view of them. The uſual deſcriptions can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſufficiently nor ſatisfactorily inform you of their real worth.</p>
                           <p>They are generally of two ſorts, broad leav'd <hi>Anemones,</hi> and narrow leav'd <hi>Anemones,</hi> thoſe with narrow leaves much reſemble Parſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100170:65"/> whence they were anciently called <hi>Roſe Parſley,</hi> or the <hi>Parſley Roſe.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Soil wherein they delight muſt be fat and rich, manured with Sheeps dung, and Neats dung, with a little mixture of Lime, all thorowly rooted.</p>
                           <p>About the end of <hi>September,</hi> or beginning of <hi>October,</hi> you may plant your <hi>Latifoles,</hi> or broad leav'd <hi>Anemones</hi> about three fingers deep, and about a Month after your <hi>Tenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foles</hi> or narrow leav'd <hi>Anemones</hi> which yield their Flowers after the other.</p>
                           <p>But if you deſign to have them more early, you may plant them ſooner, and with Mats ſecure them againſt the Cold, and give them all advantages of the Sun and warm Rains, for the Froſts are very apt to nip their Leaves when above ground, and impede their flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering for that year.</p>
                           <p>If you deſire <hi>Anemones</hi> to flower late, then keep them out of the ground as long as you can, ſome will abide out of the ground until <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> and plant them in ſhady places, or artificially ſhade them. Thus you have <hi>Anemones</hi> after the uſual natural time of flowering.</p>
                           <p>When their green Leaves turn yellow, or about the end of <hi>June,</hi> or in <hi>July,</hi> you may take them up, and preſerve the Roots dry, till the ſeaſon for interring them, for after they have loſt their Fibres, they are apt to periſh by the humidity of the Earth: the place you keep them in ought to be cool as well as dry.</p>
                           <pb n="109" facs="tcp:100170:65"/>
                           <p> It is very injurious to the <hi>Latifoles</hi> to break their Roots, which ſhould only be parted as they are naturally apt to be divided, but the <hi>Tenuifoles</hi> will endure an eaſie Rupture or Sciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                           <p>If you preſerve your <hi>Anemone</hi> Roots in a cool place, until the middle of <hi>January,</hi> and then plant them, they will be the more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from the injuries of bad weather; much Wet prejudiceth as well as ſevere Cold.</p>
                           <p>As your <hi>Anemones</hi> are prejudiced by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much Wet, ſo do they require and deſerve a little irrigation in very dry Springs, and will ſufficiently gratifie you; a little ſhade will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo advantage them in the hotteſt time of the day.</p>
                           <p>In <hi>May</hi> will theſe Flowers bear Seeds, which gathered and ſown in <hi>July,</hi> in good ſifted Earth, in Beds or Boxes, will produce great Varieties in the third or fourth year after.</p>
                           <p>Mix the Down that contains the Seeds, with ſome fair dry Earth, and rub it together in a wooden Veſſel, and the Seeds will mix with the Earth, by which means you may ſowe them equally; be ſure to ſow them not too thin.</p>
                           <p>After you have ſown your Seeds, ſift Earth upon them about half a finger in thickneſs; when they have been come up about a Month, ſift more Earth finely over them about half an inch, and cover them at ſome diſtance all the next Winter.</p>
                           <pb n="110" facs="tcp:100170:66"/>
                           <p> The <hi>August</hi> following, you may remove them into convenient Beds, where they may remain till they bear Flowers, at which time you may cull them as you pleaſe.</p>
                           <p>Forget not a gentle irrigation of your young <hi>Anemones</hi> in dry Weather, for it will much forward them, as will a little artificial ſhade at opportune Seaſons.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Ranunculus</hi> or <hi>Crowfoot,</hi> being ſo near <note place="margin">Of Ranun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus.</note> in reſemblance to the <hi>Anemone,</hi> differ very little from them in their ordering.</p>
                           <p>They exceed all Flowers whatever in the richneſs of their Colours, nor is there any Flower ſo fine and fair, as are the larger ſorts of them.</p>
                           <p>Their times of Flowering, taking up, and planting, are near about the ſame time as the <hi>Anemones,</hi> but they agree better with a richer Mold than the other.</p>
                           <p>They are not ſo apt to multiply their Roots, unleſs their Ground be rich and light; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is by the moſt skilful preſcribed, to lay a broad bed of old Thatch or almoſt rotten Straw, and on that to ſift fine rich Earth ſix or eight inches thick, and therein to plant your <hi>Ranunculus</hi>'s, wherein they will thrive and increaſe.</p>
                           <p>If you plant them early in the Winter, they muſt be defended from the ſharp Winds and Froſts, but if late, there is no neceſſity of it, they are ſomewhat more tender than the <hi>Anemone.</hi>

                           <p>Their times of Flowering are generally in <hi>July</hi> and <hi>August;</hi> ſometimes the early Buds may yield you Flowers in <hi>June,</hi> but their latter Buds in <hi>September</hi> and <hi>October</hi> and by careful defending them in <hi>November.</hi>

                           <p>The right <hi>Dutch Gilliflowers</hi> rarely produce Seed here, but when they do you muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it from wet till it be ripe, then gather it and lay it by in the Husk, until the Spring.</p>
                           <p>In <hi>May,</hi> after the cold Nights are ſpent, is a good time to ſow theſe Seeds, which ought to be on good Earth, in ſome ſhady place where it may have the Morning or Evening Sun only.</p>
                           <p>They ſhould be ſown thin, and the Earth ſifted over it half a Finger thick.</p>
                           <p>In <hi>August</hi> or <hi>September</hi> following, you may remove them into their proper Beds, and the Summer following, they will inform you of their worth by their Flowers. The ſingle and poorer ſort reject, and thoſe that blow fair and whole, or are well marked, preſerve.</p>
                           <p>For the firſt Winter after ſowing them,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:100170:68"/> there is little danger of their being hurt by Cold, in that particular they are like the ſtock <hi>Gilliflowers,</hi> which in their firſt Winter are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream heardy, and in the ſecond very tender.</p>
                           <p>You may plant your beſt <hi>Gilliflowers</hi> in Pots filled with Earth for that purpoſe, that you may give them <hi>Sun</hi> or <hi>Rain,</hi> according to the Seaſon of the Year, and as they require.</p>
                           <p>Plant them not under a Wall or other Fence, that may reflect the heat of the <hi>Sun</hi> upon them, for they delight in an open Air, and not in intemperate Heat.</p>
                           <p>Great Rains, eſpecially in the Winter and Spring, Prejudice them much, therefore you are to defend them from it equally as from Cold. Thoſe Flowers that are planted in Beds, and not in Pots, are to be defended from Wet and Cold as there is occaſion, by ſome Cover or Shelter to place over them, which muſt be open at the top, or on one ſide: The fitteſt for this occaſion, are old Bee-hives, with a Door of about a Span ſquare on the ſide that may be open off from the Weather, which you defend them againſt.</p>
                           <p>You may increaſe your Flowers by laying them in <hi>June, July</hi> and <hi>August,</hi> but in <hi>June</hi> or <hi>July</hi> is the beſt time, the method is this: Firſt trim your Slip you intend to lay, by clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping off the ſide Leaves, and topping the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then with a ſharp Pen-knife cut a Tongue half through, from one of the middle Joynts under the Slip, to the next Joynt towards you, beginning next the Root, and cutting upwards,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:100170:68"/> looſen the Earth under it, and with a ſmall hooked Stick force it down, that the Tongue or Slit may open, and the end of the Slip point upwards cover it with Earth, and water it, which irrigation muſt be reiterated according as the drought of the Seaſon requires it.</p>
                           <p>If the Slips be ſo high that they cannot be bent to the Ground with eaſe, then take a ſmall Earthen Pot with a ſlit on the ſide, in which you may diſpoſe of your Slip as you deſire.</p>
                           <p>About a Month after, your Layers will have taken Roots, then may you take them off with ſome of the adhering Earth, and plant them in their places prepared for them.</p>
                           <p>But if any ſhould not have taken root, you may anew lay them, and make the Cut a little deeper, and ſo let them remain till the Spring, and then you may plant them out as you ſee fit.</p>
                           <p>Plant your Layers not too deep, for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by many a good Plant hath been ſpoiled.</p>
                           <p>A Cave or Pit made in ſome place in your <hi>Garden,</hi> would be very convenient to place your Pots of Flowers in for there no Winds nor ſevere Froſts can annoy them, the driving Rains alſo cannot much offend them.</p>
                           <p>The Morning <hi>Sun</hi> is the moſt benign to your <hi>Gilliflowers;</hi> therefore you may defend your moſt choice from the Afternoon <hi>Sun,</hi> by ſome artificial Skreen, in caſe you have no place na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally poſited for that purpoſe: This to be done before, and in blowing time.</p>
                           <pb n="116" facs="tcp:100170:69"/>
                           <p> To have <hi>Gilliflowers</hi> or <hi>Carnations</hi> (as they are vulgarly termed from thoſe ancient <hi>Engliſh</hi> Flowers that were uſually of a Fleſh Colour) during the moſt part of the Winter, they may be placed in Pots, in ſome convenient Room open to the <hi>South,</hi> and to be ſhut at pleaſure to defend them from the Cold, unleſs to give them the benefit of the warm <hi>Sun</hi> at Noon ſometimes, or a little Southerly <hi>Rain;</hi> into which Room may be conveyed ſome warmth from your ordinary Fire, or elſe a Fire there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in on purpoſe. I ſuppoſe a Lamp may be maintained burning at an eaſie Expence in a cloſe Room, which may be ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them from Froſt; a conſtant though ſmall Heat will effect much the Lamp may alſo be enlarged as the Room or ſeverity of the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee requires; the ſmoak of the Lamp may be conveyed away by a Funnel over it for that purpoſe: thus may many other Rarities be preſerved over the Winter at an eaſie Charge.</p>
                           <p>The Earrh about your <hi>Gilliflowers,</hi> ought to be; renewed once in two Years at the leaſt, for by that time they have exhauſted the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more appropriated part of the Earth or Soyl.</p>
                           <p>Your Flower Pots ought to have holes in the bottom, to let out the ſuperfluous moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and alſo in caſe you are willing to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your Flowers, you may dip the Pots half way into a Tub of water prepared, the one after the other; and the Earth will attract the Water through the holes, which is much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than ſprinkling.</p>

                           <p> If you have any <hi>Gilliflowers</hi> that are broken, ſmall, or ſingle, you may graff on them other <hi>Gilliflowers</hi> that are more choice, but graff them in the moſt woody part of the Stalk; the beſt way is by whip-graffing.</p>

                              <hi>Pidgeons</hi> Dung being the hotteſt of Dungs, applied about the Roots of <hi>Gilliflowers,</hi> maketh them flower the more early.</p>
                           <p>To defend your <hi>Gilliflowers</hi> from the injury of Cold and Froſt, ſuch of them that are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in Beds and not moveable; ſome have preſcribed to take two ſlender Wands or bend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sticks, and fix each end in the ground on each ſide of the Flower, that the Sticks may Arch-wiſe be acroſs over the Flower, which is ſaid to defend them by ſome Magical Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
                           <p>If your <hi>Gilliflower</hi> or Layer be inclinable to ſhoot up in the Summer with one ſingle ſtem, ſuffer it not to bloſſom that Year, but nip or cut the ſtalk off, leſt it give you a fair Flower and never thrive after.</p>

                           <p>THE <hi>Lucoium</hi> or <hi>Stock-Gilliflower</hi> is a Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <note place="margin">Stock-Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liflowers.</note> of much Beauty, delicate Scent, and ſome Variety; a good <hi>Garden</hi> cannot be ſaid to be well ſtored without them, nor a Flower-pot well adorned without ſome of theſe; they continuing long in Bloſſom, from <hi>April</hi> till the Froſt prevents them. They are generally raiſed of Seed, and the firſt Winter, becauſe they have not yet ſpent their finer Spirits; they are very hardy and endure any Weather, but the next Winter they are very tender.</p>
                           <q>
                              <l>With curled Threads and top-divided now,</l>
                              <l>Along the Margin of your Borders grow</l>
                              <l>Stock-Gilliflowers, whoſe bluſhing Leaf may fear,</l>
                              <l>And juſtly too, the ſharpneſs of the Air.</l>
                           </q>
                           <p>The double, whereof ſome are ſtrip'd, and ſome plain, are very pleaſant; but the double yield no Seed.</p>
                           <p>The ſingle have generally four Leaves in a Bloſſom, but if there be five Leaves, the Seed thence produced, will bring double Flowers.</p>
                           <p>The white ſingle uſually produce double Flowers, as alſo do thoſe that are ſtrip'd with white.</p>
                           <pb n="119" facs="tcp:100170:70"/>
                           <p> The yellow double <hi>Stock-Gilliflower</hi> is the moſt rare of any.</p>
                           <p>The Seeds of thoſe kinds that uſually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce double Flowers, being often ſown in the ſame Soil, will degenerate into all ſingle, and by degrees into all plain Colours, as I have tryed. <hi>Quaere,</hi> if they will do the ſame if ſown in barren Earth.</p>
                           <p>There is another ſort of <hi>Double Stocks,</hi> that are not raiſed from Seed, only by Slips and Layers, that is more durable than the Seed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
                           <p>Thoſe raiſed of Seed will ſometimes abide the ſecond Winter if it be mild, or the Stocks well defended; if you take away the blowing Sprigs, the precedent Autumn, it will much further their duration.</p>
                           <p>They may be laid as other Plants are, and being kept ſecure from violent Colds, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Winter.</p>
                           <p>They may be planted out in Slips, if you take ſuch as are not ſpired to blow, and cut them from the Stock, and ſlit the end in three or four places about half an inch, and peel the Rind back as far as the Slit, and take away the inward Wood: Then ſet this Slip with the Rind ſpread every way about two or three fingers deep, water it and ſhade it, until it hath taken Root; by this means may you maintain your ſtock of <hi>Double-Stocks,</hi> without the two years expectation.</p>
                           <p>The Seeds from which you expect to have double Flowers, muſt be ſown at the full of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:100170:71"/> the Moon, or in two or three days after, and when come up four or five inches high, take them up and plant them out, which prevents their running up to ſtalk, which labour you may reiterate twice before Winter.</p>
                           <p>If you remove, water, and ſhade them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very time to preſerve them, (it being a Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer work) and do it the firſt time three days after the Full, and twice more before the next Change, and again three days after the next Full, and once more before the ſucceeding Change, (all theſe removes to be in barren Ground.) Then at the third Full Moon, eight days after remove them again into rich Ground, wherein they are to ſtand. It is ſaid that it <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Sir</hi> Hugh Plat.</note> will make them bring forth double Flowers.</p>
                           <p>It hath been long obſerved that the Moon hath great influence over Plants, (over Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals it is very conſpicuous.) From <hi>Pliny</hi> to this day, moſt Authors have been of that O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. And if it hath any ſuch influence, then ſurely it is in the doubling of Flowers, for we daily obſerve that many ſorts of double Flowers will degenerate themſelves into ſingle, and that moſt of thoſe double we have (which are of the kinds uſually ſingle) are propagated by Art and Induſtry, and why may not the <hi>Lunar</hi> influence contribute much thereto? The <hi>French</hi> Poet was of that Opinion, although differing as to the time,

                           <p>Of late years theſe Flowers are very much improved, not only for their great variety of plain Colours, and their bearing upright large Bunches of Bloſſoms, but for their many beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſorts of ſtripes they yield, that all the Colours that have been obſerv'd to be in that Flower plain, are now found to be mixed in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſorts of ſtripes, that they are lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the moſt beautiful Ornaments of the Spring.

                        <p> This, though mean to the eye, yet, is a Plant worthy of place among your choiceſt Flowers; in kind years and good ground it will come up, being ſown in <hi>April,</hi> and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in <hi>August:</hi> You may for the more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty raiſe it in a hot Bed; it is alſo ſaid, that if it be ſown in <hi>August,</hi> the Plants will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Winter, and blow fair the next year.</p>

                        <p>It is obſerved that the Flowers of the <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail of Peru,</hi> that are of one Colour, produce Seed, the Flowers whereof will alſo be but of one Colour. Therefore if you would have varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Flowers you muſt take the Seed from ſuch Flowers that be variable, and ſow them apart from the other.</p>

                           <p>AS in the former part of this Treatiſe we began at the more hardy <hi>Winter Greens,</hi> ſo here it will be not unproper to obſerve the ſame order. And as there we named the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Cypreſs</hi> firſt, ſo here ſhall we begin with the moſt beloved odoriferous <hi>Myrtle,</hi> ſo highly <note place="margin">Of the Myrtle.</note> eſteem'd by <hi>Romans,</hi> the great Admirers of Rarities, before the Foundation of <hi>Rome:</hi> That the ſweet perfume thereof when burn'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an Attonement for the Offence the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> had committed in raviſhing the <hi>Sabine</hi> Virgins. And its Sacred Branches (being firſt conſecrated I ſuppoſe) were ſufficient to puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them from ſo Venial a Sin. In memory of which Offence, and Satisfaction, on that very place the zealous <hi>Romans</hi> then erected a Sacrd Temple dedicated to <hi>Venus Cloacina,</hi> the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs <note place="margin">Cloacina.</note> of ſuch pleaſures and patroneſs of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent <hi>Myrtle. Myrtle</hi> Trees were alſo by the ſame <hi>Romans</hi> planted and propagated as O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens or Prognoſticks of good or evil to their State and Government. So ſuperſtitious were they ever eſteemed.</p>
                           <p>In <hi>Pliny's</hi> time there was an old Temple and Altar that had been conſecrated to <hi>Venus Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea.</hi>

                              <hi>Pliny</hi> attributes a ſtrange effect to it, that if a man hath a great Journey to go on foot, and carry in his hand a Stick or Rod of the <hi>Myrtle-Tree,</hi> he ſhould not be weary nor think his day long and tedious: It's probable its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are more vigorous in ſuch places where it naturally delights, than here where a kind of force is put upon it. But we here in <hi>England</hi> can ſecond this Vertue in that of an <hi>Elder-ſtick,</hi> which if a young Horſeman carry in his poc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, although he ride hard and far, yet ſhall he not be galled; as ſome affirm.</p>
                           <p>There are ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Myrtles</hi> here known in <hi>England;</hi> there is the broad leav'd <hi>Myrtle,</hi> and the narrow leav'd <hi>Myrtle,</hi> both very fine ſweet ſmelling Shurbs; but the moſt elegant is that which in the <hi>Autumn</hi> affords ſuch plenty of double white Bloſſoms, being a Plant very worthy the care of the moſt ingenious <hi>Floriſt,</hi> and are not ſo great a vexation as delight; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Mr. <hi>Rea's</hi> opinion is, <hi>Rapinus</hi> ſeems to be of another.</p>

                           <p> They are raiſed of the Kernels ſown in <hi>March</hi> in Caſes of rich Earth: Theſe Fruits were unknown in former Ages to the <hi>Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and the Trees have not been long intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd; and not many years hath that more noble kind, the <hi>China Orange</hi> been propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in <hi>Portugal</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> which annually fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with thoſe pleaſant Fruits, yet there in a few years have they degenerated, as to ſize and taſte: It's probable the Kernels of thoſe may proſper better with us than the <hi>African, China</hi> being not ſo hot.</p>
                           <p>The Fruit with us, although it ripeneth not ſo well as in <hi>Spain,</hi> yet in ſuch years that our old ſtock of imported Fruit is decay'd; they ſerve for many Phyſical uſes. But the Flowers here are much more valuable than the Fruit.</p>
                           <p>Therefore if a Wall be built near the Houſe, and well defended behind, and on either ſide from cold Winds, and ſeveral Leaves or Doors of cloſe Board made to ſhut before your Wall, and the top well ſecured from Rain; againſt this Wall may you plant your <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> and prune them againſt it without ever remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them; only in the Spring ſeaſon, you may open your Leaves or Doors by Degrees, and at length open it quite before and on the top, only in the main ſtays until the next Winter. In the building of this Wall may you contrive Concavities, through which the heat of Fire made in ſeveral places for that purpoſe, may paſs behind your Trees, or you may have other Fires in this Shed as in your Green-houſe.</p>
                           <pb n="140" facs="tcp:100170:81"/>
                           <p> The moſt proper Earth wherein to Plant your <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> is that which is taken out of a Melon, or Cucumber-bed, and equally mix'd or temper'd with a fine loamy Earth, and ſo to remain the whole Winter, then ſift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the Caſes.</p>
                           <p>Inſtead of the fat Earth of a Melon, or Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumber-bed, you may uſe Neats-dung, and order it as the Melon Earth.</p>
                           <p>Before you put your Earth into your Caſes, lay on the bottom a good quantity of Oſier or Withy Sticks, or ſuch like, which will preſerve it light; if they are in a ſmall quantity mixed throughout, it will be the better.</p>
                           <p>Place them in your Conſervatory before any Froſts happen, and in hard Weather give them ſome warmth.</p>
                           <p>As the Spring appears, ſo acquaint them by degrees with the Air, opening the Doors at Noon firſt, and ſhutting them again, then for a whole Day, if the Weather permit. The like diſcretion you muſt uſe when you ſet them into your Conſervatory, not to ſhut them up too cloſe until extremity of Weather require it.</p>
                           <p>As the Trees grow large, ſo you may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large your Caſes, and take out the Trees, Earth and all, and place them in your new Caſes.</p>
                           <p>I have heard of a Gentleman that annually makes a Shed or Houſe over his <hi>Orange-Tree,</hi> and as the Tree encreaſeth, ſo he enlargeth his Houſe, and that his Tree is very large, and beareth plentifully.</p>
                           <pb n="141" facs="tcp:100170:81"/>
                           <p> You muſt gather the Flowers as they blow, leaving but few to knit into Fruit, elſe will your Tree ſpend it ſelf in Fruit.</p>
                           <p>You muſt take care to bruſh the Spiders Webs off this Tree very gently, for they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to work on it; the fragrant Bloſſoms at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting many Flies.</p>
                           <p>The Kernels may be Planted in hot Beds, and will bring fair Plants the ſooner.</p>
                           <p>Eaſie <hi>Stoves</hi> or <hi>Heats</hi> will ſerve until the Froſts be very hard; then you muſt kindle greater Fires, but let not any Fire come too near your Trees, nor any Smoak annoy them. But if your Conſervatory be made very cloſe with Mats, that Water will not freeze in it, then there needs not any Fire.</p>
                           <p>You muſt water them gently when you find they require it, which may be diſcerned by the Leaf which will ſoon complain, but give them rather too little than too much, and wet not the Leaves.</p>
                           <p>You ought to renew and alter the Earth as tenderly as you can, by abating the upper part of it, and ſtirring it up with a Fork, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king heed to the Roots, and applying the prepared Earth in the room of it, which may be done in <hi>May</hi> and <hi>September.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If you kindle ſome Charcoal, and when they have done ſmoaking, put them in a hole ſunk a little into the Floor, about the middle of it; it is the beſt Stove, and leaſt annoys your Plants.</p>
                           <pb n="142" facs="tcp:100170:82"/>
                           <p> The Water wherewith you irrigate your <hi>Orange-Trees,</hi> ought to be prepared as well as the Earth, you may therefore mix it with Sheeps-dung, or Neats-dung, and let it ſtand two or three days in the <hi>Air</hi> or <hi>Sun,</hi> and it will be very fit for your purpoſe.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Lemmons</hi> may be ordered after the ſame <note place="margin">Lemmons.</note> manner as the <hi>Oranges,</hi> but they are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of giving you ſo large a requital.</p>

                           <p>The Root muſt be taken up in <hi>April,</hi> care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully parted without breaking the greater Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and then replanted, the bottom of the Pot filled with prepared Earth, but the Roots covered only with natural freſh Earth, and then the Pot filled with Earth prepared, as before; place this Pot in a hot Bed, and there let it ſtand without watering until the Root ſpring, then ſet the Pot under a

                           <p>In <hi>September</hi> you may take up the Bulbs of this Plant, and preſerve them in dry Sand, or when the Roots are dry, lay them up in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in a warm Cloſet.</p>

                     <p>AS a <hi>Garden</hi> is the greateſt Ornament to your Seat without doors, for the variety of Pleaſures it yields, ſo is it of as great advantage and ſatisfaction for the variety it affords you of curious Aliments and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at your Table; not any Diſh of Meat can be compleatly ſerved up, without a ſhare of ſome <hi>Hortulan</hi> or other Vegetable.</p>
                     <p>The meaneſt Cottager may well afford that little ground (if he hath any) that is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to his Tenement, for the propagating of ſome or other of theſe <hi>Eſculents</hi> we are now to treat of: It is not the heat or Colours, Fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Barrenneſs of his Land can excuſe him here, for there is no Land but is apt to bring you ſome Fruit or other of your Labour, and wherein ſome of theſe Plants do delight: If it be a dry hot ſandy Land, <hi>Carrots</hi> will proſper in it; if cold and dry, then <hi>Turnips,</hi> if hot and moiſt, then <hi>Peaſe, Beans,</hi> and moſt ſorts of Tillage; if cold and moiſt, then <hi>Cabbages,</hi>
                        <pb n="146" facs="tcp:100170:84"/> 
                        <hi>Beans,</hi> &amp;c. will not diſdain it; Thus may ſome ſort of Tillage or other be adapted to every ſort of Land.</p>
                     <p>The accidental or caſual thriving of Plants or Seeds in the various ſorts of Lands hath, within the memory of Man, very much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged our Ruſticks to a farther improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this part of Husbandry, not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the products of their Labours have often found a good Market for curious Pallats, but becauſe they have been frugal Meats for their own Families, and ſometimes neceſſity alſo (which often makes Men ingenious) hath put them upon the propagation of theſe <hi>Eſculents,</hi> which have ſerved as Meat, Bread and Drink, in ſuch years that Corn hath been ſcarce. For in a great part of the World, the Inhabitants never were acquainted with the making of Bread of Corn, but ſometimes of the Roots of ſome Plants that grew amongſt them, which they eat with their hunted Veniſon, or with their Milk, as in <hi>Ireland</hi> they eat <hi>Potatoes;</hi> thus here in <hi>England, Carrots, Turnips, Caba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> and many other Roots and Plants have been both Bread and Meat, for the Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and his Family, who have in many places ſubſiſted long on this Food; and theſe Eſculents being of themſelves of a fine nutrimental and moiſt nature, have not required ſo much Drink as other Meats more dry and ſalt uſually do: Theſe kind of Diets are at a far leſs Charge and trouble to the <hi>Pater-familiae,</hi> than thoſe of <hi>Fleſh, Bread, Cheeſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:100170:84"/>
                     <p> And if the Caſe were truly ſtated, and the Times compared, the improvement and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of theſe Eſculents hath been one Principal cauſe of the deadneſs of the Market for Corn, which probably may be objected againſt this deſign.</p>
                     <p>To anſwer which you may conſider, that cheap Food is one of the greateſt encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for the peopling of a Country, for this very reaſon many thouſands have deſerted <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> to ſettle in <hi>Ireland</hi> and elſewhere, to our great detriment, and their great advantage.</p>
                     <p>If any Farmer complain of the Effects of theſe Improvements, then let him make uſe of the ſame, and ſet out yearly a parcel of his Farm, for the raiſing of Garden-Tillage, wherewith to feed his own Family, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Market.</p>
                     <p>Then will it be objected, that in caſe every man ſhould ſo improve a part of his Ville, the prices of the Tillage would be low, and it would not quit the Coſt.</p>
                     <p>To anſwer which, It would then reduce the advantage of the one and the other part of Husbandry to a Ballance, from which no ill effect as to the general can proceed.</p>
                     <p>It may be further objected, that ſeeing leſs Land will, by theſe ways of improvement, feed a certain number of people, than the old way of Husbandry can do, that much Land will therefore lie waſt.</p>
                     <p>In anſwer whereunto, If you can raiſe as much Food on an Acre of Land, as formerly
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:100170:85"/> you did on four Acres, what diſadvantage to you is it in caſe the three remaining Acres lie waſt? but you may convert them to paſture, if you pleaſe.</p>
                     <p>In caſe you object that Garden-Tillage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more hands, to <hi>dig, trench, ſet, ſow, plant, weed,</hi> and <hi>gather in,</hi> thatn the former way of ſowing of Corn.</p>
                     <p>Anſwer, This is one of the Advantages it will neceſſarily produce, that Man and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily may live and keep themſelves daily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in this method of Husbandry, on a few Acres of Land to as equal an advantage, as by the more ancient way they could on a great Farm: For it were much better for the publick, that the great Farms were ſubdivided into leſſer, that the people might have Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Employments here at home to keep them from ſtragling abroad, than to have ſo many great Farms lie ſo neglected, to the great prejudice of the Commonweal: <hi>Palladius</hi> was of the ſame opinion, who ſaid, <hi>Foecundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or eſt culta Exiguitas, quam magnitudo neglecta.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if you will ſay, that by multiplying <hi>Garden.</hi> Tillage after this manner, it will make Corn-land ſo low rented and Corn thereby to become cheap, to the great detriment to the kingdom in general. Then conſider, that if a part of our Land will yield us Food ſufficient, and uphold the yearly value of our Villes, as by this Method it will cartainly do, then may there be Corn enough raiſed in <hi>England,</hi> not only to ballance, but under-ſell
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:100170:85"/> our foreign Neighbours, to our great a dvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and their detriment (which is almoſt equal to it;) for the more of our own Growths we can vend, the more is Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion encouraged, and the greater Returns are made. It is when the Growths or Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures of other Contries are imported hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and in lieu of them ready Money return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that impoveriſhes us, and enriches them. Therefore when the contrary is done, it muſt have a contrary effect.</p>
                     <p>The Private Advantages of the propagating <hi>Hortulans</hi> or Eſculent plants, as they are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> repreſented, are prodigious and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, therefore a modeſt computation is the beſt encouragement; for any rational man will more eaſily believe that an Acre of <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips, Carrots, Onions,</hi> or the like, is four or five times more profitable to the Husbandman, than an Acre of Wheat or Barley, or ſuch like, than if it ſhould be ſaid to be ten or twenty times more profitable.</p>
                     <p>But for your <hi>Garden</hi> (where you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a leſs Room than a Farm) which is divided into ſeveral ſquares or quarters, and each ſquare or quarter well manured and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for its proper Tillage, there may you expect a far greater encreaſe, eſpecially of ſuch plants that annually produce their Fruit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the renewing of the Gardeners Coſt and Pains, unleſs only to cheriſh and preſerve them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the planting and propagating of which ſort of Eſculents we will begin.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of ſuch Plants that are Perennial, or continue over the Year.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THE beſt and moſt ſelect of ſuch Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culent <note place="margin">Of Aſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus.</note> Plants that continue from Year to Year, without new planting or ſowing, is the <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> which deſerves to be firſt named, becauſe of its early and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful encreaſe it yields, the delicacy of its Meat, and the continuance of it before any other, gains a repute above it.</p>
                        <p>So long ſince as in <hi>Pliny's</hi> time it was the moſt eſteem'd of any in the <hi>Garden,</hi> although in thoſe parts they ſometimes grew wild, yet in the <hi>Gardens</hi> were they ſo cultivated, that three of their Buds or Heads would weigh a pound, and were (though common) the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> dainty Diſh: And <hi>Cato</hi> many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pliny</hi> wrote very much concerning their propagation, out of the abundant regard he had for them, being then but newly reduced to the Gardener's care.</p>
                        <p>They grow naturally wild, or at leaſt ſome Baſtard kind of them in the Meadows near <hi>Briſtol;</hi> but our more fair and large, uſually called <hi>Dutch Aſparagus</hi> are propagated from
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:100170:86"/> Seed; the Ground wherein you ſow them muſt be rich and well tempered and prepared; then may you with your Finger prick in the Berries at what diſtance you pleaſe; the beſt time is in <hi>January</hi> or <hi>February.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then after two years, in <hi>March</hi> following, will they be fit to remove into the Bed where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are to remain.</p>
                        <p>But the beſt and moſt expeditious way is, to buy your Plants of two or three years growth of the <hi>Gardeners,</hi> who raiſe them on purpoſe for Sale at an eaſie price.</p>
                        <p>The Bed you plant them in ought to be three or four foot wide, and about two foot in depth, the moſt part within the ſurface of the earth, and about ſix inches above, for it will ſettle. When you have made clean and ſquare your Foſs, you may fill it with good rotten Dung of any ſort, with a little mixture of earth, the beſt Soyl is that which the Butchers make, wherein there are Hoofs, Rams-horns, or any ſuch cornuous ſubſtance, wherein they exceedingly delight; it's proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble woollen Rags or old Leather may do as well; with theſe mixtures may you fill your Bed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eighteen inches; then cover the ſame with good old rich Mold, that came out of ſome <hi>Cucumber</hi> or <hi>Melon</hi> Bed for about ſix in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches more, in the midſt whereof plant your Sets, at ſixteen or eighteen inches diſtance in a <hi>Quincunical</hi> order, that they may lie coverd two or three inches; plant them with their Roots ſpreading as much as you can. Or you may
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100170:87"/> cover the Dung with rich Mould, three inches, and then place your Sets with the Roots ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then gently cover them with the like Mold three inches.</p>
                        <p>You may make as many of theſe Beds, and as long as you pleaſe, leaving a two foot inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val between them, for the conveniency of dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and cutting them, for broad Beds are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, no Tillage ſuffering more by tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than theſe.</p>
                        <p>About three years after they are planted you may cut of them: the ſooner you cut of them, the more will the head of the Root knit, and the more in number will it yearly yield you; and the later you cut, the more will the Root and head grow in bigneſs, and the fairer Bud will you have. Some will thus grow to be very large.</p>
                        <p>When <hi>Green Peaſe</hi> furniſh your Table, then may you let your <hi>Aſparagus</hi> run to Seed, that they may gather ſtrength for the ſucceeding year.</p>
                        <p>In the cutting the Buds remove ſome of the Earth with your knife, to avoid injuring the next Succeſſor.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>November,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> cut the ſeedy ſtalk cloſe to the ground, and cover the Beds with new warm Horſe-dung, which will prevent them from extream Froſts, for no other will injure them.</p>
                        <p>In the beginning of <hi>March</hi> uncover them if the Weather be open, and either before you cover them, or at this time, weed them clean,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100170:87"/> and after weeding lay on your Bed the Bottom of a <hi>Melon</hi> or <hi>Cucumber</hi> Bed, or ſuch like rich Earth, about two fingers thick, to ſupply the uſual decay they are ſubject unto.</p>
                        <p>You may have early <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> if you take the old Roots with the Earth about them, and place them on a hot Bed, thus will they bud in <hi>January.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>By the precedent Rules will a <hi>Garden</hi> of <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragus</hi> furniſh you with Buds near three Months of the year, without the force of a hot Bed, and that in ſuch plenty, that no other tillage whatever, that is the perennial (the <hi>Artichoak</hi> only excepted) affords the like. Theſe whilſt leſs common, were received as Dainties at the beſt furniſh'd Tables; and now, though plentiful, are they an uſual Diſh at moſt Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens Tables, and by degrees may come to be a more vulgar Diet; for after their firſt Planting, the labour about them is but ſmall, and the coſt leſs, the trouble of cutting them not ſo great as gathering of Peaſe, nor dreſſing them ſo tedious, yet a Meat equalling the beſt of Tillage, and the moſt ſalubrious of any.</p>
                        <p>About the time the <hi>Aſparagus</hi> leaves you, <note place="margin">Of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choaks.</note> the <hi>Artichoak</hi> comes in requeſt, being one of the beſt of a <hi>Gardens</hi> products, and anciently derived from <hi>Thiſtles,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> tells us, and in his time, and long before, had been ſo impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that they became a moſt delicate Meat, and were ſerved up to the Tables of the moſt prodigal <hi>Romans.</hi> If then they were ſo excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, ſurely by a continued improvement to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100170:88"/> this day, muſt they needs now be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                        <p>There are ſeveral kinds of them, as the more ordinary which run up tall, and bear ſmall heads which are very hardy, and are uſually called the <hi>Thiſtle-Artichoaks;</hi> the other ſorts are more large, and grow low, and much to be preferred, but are more tender and unable to endure the ſeverity of the Winter.</p>
                        <p>The beſt and largeſt ſort is that called the <hi>Globe-Artichoak,</hi> bearing a very large Fruit of near twelve inches over. The meaneſt is that called the <hi>Red Artichoak,</hi> with the Plants where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many have been deceived, expecting a more excellent than ordinary Fruit, when inſtead thereof they produced the worſt of <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choaks.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They are increaſed by Slips, taken from the ſides of the old Roots at the time of dreſſing them in the Spring, with as much root to them as you can.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Artichoaks</hi> delight in a rich and deep Soyl, and not very dry, which Soyl muſt be trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about two foot deep, and mixed very well with good old rotten Dung, and ſo laid up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Beds of what form you think beſt, for you may go between them as you pleaſe; the <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choak</hi> roots very deep, and if it likes its ground will grow very large, and continue many years.</p>
                        <p>You may plant them four foot apart at leaſt, that they may have room to ſpread their leaves, and at their firſt planting be fure to water them
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100170:88"/> in dry Weather until you obſerve them to grow.</p>
                        <p>The beſt times for the planting them is in the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> and you may ſow any Sallet-Herbs between them, that may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and diſpoſed of before the <hi>Artichoaks</hi> ſpread too far. Theſe Plants will ſome of them yield heads in the <hi>Autumn</hi> following.</p>
                        <p>If you throughly water your <hi>Artichoaks</hi> with water enriched with Sheeps-Dung, it will make them very large: Watring of them in dry Land, or in dry Years, much advantageth them, for in moiſt Years they are much more plentiful and large than in dry Years, and the better it will be in caſe the Water be fat.</p>
                        <p>Water drawn from Aſhes, or improved by any fixed Salt, is very good for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for I have known that <hi>Artichoaks</hi> have been the larger for Turf-aſhes, caſually with Dung laid at their Roots to preſerve them in Winter.</p>
                        <p>In <hi>November,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>December,</hi> it will be a good time to ſecure your <hi>Artichoaks</hi> from the Froſt, by raiſing the Earth about them, and encompaſſing them with long Dung, or any hawmy ſubſtance, but not to cover them, leſt it periſh them, for it's the Froſt that periſheth the Roots, and the wet and want of Air that periſh the Leaves.</p>
                        <p>About <hi>London</hi> where they have great <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> of <hi>Artichoaks,</hi> they cannot ſo well cover them with long Dung; but inſtead thereof they cut off all the Greens, which they ſell for
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:100170:89"/> feeding of Cows, after the rate of 20 <hi>s. per</hi> Acre, as they themſelves tell me, and then cover the plants over with Earth, to defend them from Froſts; ſo that it is not neceſſary to preſerve the Greens over the Winter.</p>
                        <p>But this way of covering them with Earth did not preſerve them in the great Froſt of 1683 when all ſo covered were killed; and at the ſame time thoſe that were covered well with long Dung were preſerved, in the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler <hi>Gardens</hi> remote from <hi>London:</hi> and ſome that were buried in Dung all that winter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt out of the <hi>Gardens,</hi> were found in the Spring to be living.</p>
                        <p>Some preſcribe to whelm over them an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Pot, Bee-hive, or ſuch like open at the top to give them Air, which may ſerve if the Winter be not too ſharp.</p>
                        <p>About the middle of <hi>March,</hi> you may gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly move the Dung from them, and at the end, the Earth that was caſt up, and the firſt week in <hi>April</hi> may you dreſs them, by digging deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about each Root, and ſlipping of every Set as low as poſſibly you can, leaving two or three of the greateſt and moſt diſtant the one from the other for Bearers, then fill them up round with good old Dung or rich Soil mixt with the Earth, and they will afford you fair Heads.</p>
                        <p>If you would have latter <hi>Artichoaks,</hi> you muſt cut the firſt Crops betimes, or expect them from your new ſet plants.</p>
                        <p>A ſmall ſpot of ground thus planted and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, will furniſh your Table with many of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100170:89"/> theſe Fruits in a year, and are equal to the beſt of Vegetables for Food; charge and trouble and very little in compariſon of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                        <p>They will continue ſix, eight or ten years, ſometimes twenty years and more, according to the goodneſs of the Land they grow in, and then muſt be renewed when you perceive them to degenerate; which they ſurely do if they like not the ground.</p>
                        <p>The young Buds of <hi>Artichoaks</hi> may be eaten raw with Pepper and Salt, as uſually <hi>Melons, Figs,</hi> &amp;c. are eaten.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Chard</hi> of the <hi>Artichoaks,</hi> which is the Stalk of a young <hi>Artichoak,</hi> ariſing out of an old Root, and preſerved from the Air, and from heading, by winding it about with Straw, to blanch it and make it tender, is by the <hi>French</hi> eſteem'd an excellent Diſh.</p>
                        <p>The Roots, Stalks, and Leaves of them, whilſt young and tender, are delicate Meat, eſpecially if ſo preſerved and blanched as is by ſome affirmed; and it is not improbable, for I have often found that by covering a Winter Bud to preſerve it from Froſt, the Snails have greedily devour'd it.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe eſculent Herbs that are perennial, becauſe they are not ſo much uſed for Food as for Condiment, I ſhall diſcourſe of in another Chapter.</p>

                        <head>CHAP. II. <hi>Of Eſculent Roots.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THere are ſeveral Roots that have afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us great plenty of ſubſtantial, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant <note place="margin">Of Turnips.</note> and wholeſome Food, whereof the <hi>Turnip</hi> is eſteem'd the beſt; there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſorts of them, the round, long, and yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, of which the round is the moſt common, though the others are very good; the long are uſually called <hi>Navews;</hi> they have been an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Food throughout <hi>Europe</hi> Southward, and have been very much improved in <hi>England</hi> of late years.</p>
                        <p>They will grow on the meaneſt Land in its firſt tilth, and much the more if the Seaſon prove moiſt or dripping. The Seaſon of ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them is about <hi>Midſummer,</hi> that they may be ready to improve upon the <hi>Autumnal Rains,</hi> which maketh them much ſweeter than the <hi>Vernal.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They are fickle at their firſt coming up in a too dry Seaſon, and if (being ſown early) they happen to fail, you may at the end of <hi>July,</hi> or beginning of <hi>Auguſt</hi> new ſow your Ground.</p>
                        <p>Theſe Seeds are much ſought for and devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by ſmall Birds, who will ſmell them in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:100170:90"/> the ground, and when they firſt ſend their pale heads above the earth the Birds will draw them out and eat of their Seeds, and leave the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Shoots on the ground. Thoſe that eſcape the Birds in ſmall <hi>Gardens</hi> or places, amongſt, or near to Trees and Groves, as well as in the larger Fields, the Flies in dry and hot Summers uſually devour; ſo that few or none eſcape them: which to prevent, ſome have affirmed, that if you take Soot of Chimnies, and lay it in Water, till the Water be ſtrongly tinged therewith, and with that imbibe your Seed, and then ſow it, neither the Birds nor Flies will meddle with it.</p>
                        <p>You may ſow them in <hi>April,</hi> to have Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips in the Summer, but ſowing them after for the Winter is moſt ſeaſonable.</p>
                        <p>In the Winter before the great Froſts pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, you may take them up, and cutting off the Greens, diſpoſe of them in ſome cool place on heaps, and they will keep long, and much better and longer in caſe they be laid in Sand and covered with it.</p>
                        <p>They will root the better and larger if the Leaves ſpread and grow flat, than if they ſtand upright or grow upwards; which to prevent, ſow them not too thick, or if they come up too thick in any place, reduce them to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient number or diſtance of about ten or twelve inches, and ſupply the defects by tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplantation, and you will find that the increaſe of your Root ſhall ballance the leſſening your number, for the near ſtanding of any Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:100170:91"/> cauſe them to aſpire upwards, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in moſt Trees planted in Copſes; which otherwiſe are apt to ſpread.</p>
                        <p>But if the over fatneſs of your Ground, which is a great fault for <hi>Turnips,</hi> or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much wet, cauſe them to run out in leaf more than in root, then treading down the leafs will make them root the better.</p>
                        <p>The Greens or Leaves of <hi>Turnips</hi> that have been ſown late, and lived over the Winter, are uſually boyled and eaten with ſalt Meats, and prove an excellent Condiment.</p>
                        <p>Thus ordered, will a ſmall ſpot of Ground yield you a ſecond Crop (after <hi>Peaſe, Beans,</hi> or <hi>Sallee-Herbs)</hi> of excellent Food, which the moſt curious plates diſdain not, and much more in value then any of Corn or Grain whatever.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Carrots</hi> have been anciently uſed for Meat, <note place="margin">Of Carrots.</note> but not ſo much as <hi>Turnips</hi> have been, yet are they the ſweeter Meat, and more eaſily eaten without Bread, or rather better ſerve to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that cefect than <hi>Turnips,</hi> for <hi>Turnips</hi> are much the better Condiment, but <hi>Carrots</hi> the pleaſanter Food.</p>
                        <p>There are two ſorts of them, the yellow, and the Orange, or more red: the laſt of which is by much the better.</p>
                        <p>They delight in light Ground with a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Sand; if it be rich or heavy, you muſt take the more pains in digging it, to make it as light as you can.</p>

                        <p>To make them large, you muſt do with them as with the <hi>Turnips,</hi> only they will admit of a greater number on the ſame quantity of ground than the other.</p>

                        <p>The firſt is that which hath been ſo much in repute, and is now ordinarily eaten, and is raiſed of Seed.</p>
                        <p>To have them early they muſt be raiſed on a hot Bed, with a ſnfficient thickneſs of good rich light Moul, that they may have depth enough to root in before they reach the Dung.</p>
                        <p>To have large and clean <hi>Radiſhes,</hi> make. holes as deep as your finger about three inches diſtance, into each hole drop a ſound Seed (or two if ſuſpitious) and cover the Seeds a little, leaving the reſt of the hole open; thus will they growe to the height of the hole ere they dilate their Leaves, and yield you a long and tranſparent Root.</p>
                        <p>You may ſowe them all the year, thoſe in the Winter in hot Beds, thoſe ſown after <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummer</hi> will not run to Seed that year.</p>
                        <p>They delight in rich and light ground, and require watring, for in dripping years they prove faireſt.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Horſe Radiſh</hi> is increaſed by Plants, as <note place="margin">Horſe Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhes.</note> well as from Seeds, and uſed by many as an excellent and wholeſom Sauce.</p>
                        <p>The black <hi>Radiſh</hi> is ſo mean a Root that it <note place="margin">Black Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh.</note> finds no place in a good <hi>Garden.</hi>

                           <hi>Onions</hi> are an ancient Food, eſpecially of <note place="margin">Of Onions.</note> the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and are much eſteem'd of by the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who eat them as <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> do Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, for in the hotter Countries they are a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle milder than here.</p>
                        <p>There are ſeveral ſorts of them, the <hi>Straſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh</hi> Onion, red <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> white <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> the red the moſt tart, and the white the mildeſt; the ordinary <hi>Engliſh</hi> are not ſo fair as thoſe of <hi>Biſcay</hi> or St. <hi>Omers,</hi> but theſe by often ſowing degenerate.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>They delight in good Land well tempered and freed from Weeds, they extend not their Fibers far downwards, therefore in your ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them tread your Bed or beat, it flat, then ſowe it with your Seed as equally diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as you can, and not too thick, then ſift over in fine rich Earth, a finger thick at moſt; by this means the root will grow larger, and not be apt to run into the ground, for an <hi>Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and a <hi>Turnip,</hi> the more on the ſurface they grow, the fairer they prove: This I had from an experienced perſon.</p>

                           <hi>Omons</hi> ſown with Salt are ſaid to proſper and grow large; it is not improbable, becauſe they ſeem to extract much of the blackiſh moiſture of the Earth.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>GArden-Beans</hi> are an ancient Food, eſteem'd by <hi>Pliny</hi> the principal of all Pulſe, they are a very ſtrong and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Meat. <hi>Pythagoras</hi> forbid his Scholars the eating of <hi>Beans,</hi> only (as is ſuppoſed) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were a rough Meat, and diſturbed their ſedate minds in the Night, and are not therefore ſo good for Philoſophers nor Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. The greater ſort which we vulgarly call <hi>Sanwich Beans,</hi> are by much to be preferr'd for their fruitfulneſs and goodneſs.</p>
                        <p>They may be ſet in <hi>November,</hi> and at any time after till <hi>May,</hi> but moſt ſecurely in <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> for if they begin to ſpire, and very ſevere Froſts happen after it, they may be all deſtroyed. <hi>Probatum est.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It is not good to ſet them promiſcuouſly, but in double ranges, at three foot diſtance at leaſt, the Ranges running from North to South, the Sun will comfort and ripen them the better.</p>
                        <pb n="171" facs="tcp:100170:96"/>
                        <p> If you cut off the Stalks of your Beans near the ground; when they are firſt ripe, the Roots will ſpring again, and in ſeaſonable Years you may have a ſecond Crop about <hi>Michaelmas.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>From whence we may conclude, that if you cut off your Beans that are ſet in the Spring, at ſuch times as they begin to blow, then they will germinate again into more Branches and bear late, much better than if they were Planted late, which extream drowth uſually hinders from coming to perfection.</p>
                        <p>There is a ſmall ſort of Bean called a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Bean that ripens early, and therefore to be preferr'd,</p>

                           <hi>Kidney Beans</hi> were as ancient a Food as the <note place="margin">Of Kidney Beans.</note> other, and in very great eſteem with the old <hi>Italians;</hi> yet within the Memory of Man were a great rarity here in <hi>England,</hi> although now a known and common delicate Food.</p>
                        <p>They delight in a warm, light, and fertile ground, which being well ſtirr'd, and about <hi>May-</hi>day, or very little ſooner, planted with the <hi>Kidney-Beans,</hi> at about a foot apart, and two fingers deep, will yield you an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Crop.</p>
                        <p>You may either ſet tall Sticks near for them to twine about, or let them lie on the ground, but if you are ſtraitned in room, thoſe on Sticks will yield you the greateſt encreaſe.</p>
                        <p>Of theſe there are 4 ſorts, 1. The <hi>Scarlet Bean,</hi> which yieldeth a rough husk, and is not the beſt to eat in the ſhell as <hi>Kidney Beans</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100170:97"/> are eaten, but is reputed the beſt to be eaten in the Winter when dry and boyled. 2. The <hi>Painted</hi> or <hi>Streaked Bean,</hi> which is the hardieſt although the meaneſt of all, and is known, the dry Bean being all over ſtreaked with a dark Colour. 3. The large <hi>White Bean,</hi> which yields a fair and delicate Pod. 4. The ſmall <hi>White Bean,</hi> which except in ſize is like the latter, but eſteem'd the ſweeter.</p>
                        <p>There is another ſort much like the laſt, thaat <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Bona Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta</hi>'s.</note> is natural to the Iſland <hi>Bona Viſta,</hi> and thence taken and propagated in the <hi>Summer</hi> Iſlands, from whence ſome certain perſons have them dry, and eſteem them as delicate Meat; they will flouriſh well here in Branch, but our Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers are not long enough to bring them to maturity, <hi>Quaere,</hi> if raiſed on a hot Bed.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Peaſe</hi> are of divers kinds, and ſome of them <note place="margin">Of Peaſe.</note> the ſweeteſt and moſt pleaſant of all Pulſes; the meaner ſort of them have been long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Air and Soil; but the ſweet and delicate ſorts of them have been introduced into our <hi>Gardens</hi> only in this latter Age.</p>
                        <p>There are divers ſorts of peaſe now propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in <hi>England,</hi> as three ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Hot-ſpurs,</hi> the long, the ſhorts and <hi>Barns's Hot-ſpur. Sandwich,</hi> five ſorts of <hi>Rouncivals,</hi> the Grey, White, Blue, Green, and Maple <hi>Rouncival.</hi> Three ſorts of <hi>Sugar Peaſe,</hi> the large White, ſmall White, and Grey <hi>Sugar Peaſe.</hi> The <hi>Egg-Peaſe, Wing Peaſe,</hi> and <hi>Sickle Peaſe;</hi> whereof the <hi>Hot-ſpurs</hi> are the moſt early, pleaſant, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100170:97"/> profitable of all others. The <hi>Sugar Peaſe</hi> with crooked Cods, the ſweeteſt of all. The large white and green <hi>Rouncival,</hi> and the great <hi>Egg-Peaſe</hi> we ſhall more particularly adviſe to be propagated in our <hi>Gardens.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Hot-ſpurs</hi> are the ſpeedieſt of growth of any, that being ſown about the middle of <hi>May</hi> will in ſix Weeks time return ripe again into your hands, no Vegetable beſides being ſo quick in its growth and maturity; therefore let theſe be the firſt that you ſow, if ſown in <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> they will come earlier than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſort ſown before Winter; but if you ſow them in <hi>September,</hi> and can by Fences of Reed, or otherwiſe defend them from extream Froſts, you may have ripe Peaſcods in <hi>May</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                        <p>The large <hi>Sugar Peaſe</hi> (which many take to be a fair white ſweet <hi>Peaſe</hi> ſucceeding the <hi>Hot-ſpur,</hi> but erroniouſly) is a tender <hi>Peaſe</hi> Planted in <hi>April,</hi> and ripe after <hi>Midſummer,</hi> the Cods are very crooked and ill-ſhaped, which being boyl'd with the unripe <hi>Peaſe</hi> in them, are extraordinary ſweet. The greateſt diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement in raiſing theſe, is that their ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs attracts the ſmall Birds unto them, to their total deſtruction, unleſs carefully prevented; which is a ſufficient Argument of their pre-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.</p>
                        <p>The large white and green <hi>Rouncivals,</hi> or <hi>Haſtings,</hi> are tender, and not to be ſet till the cold is over, and then not very thick, for they ſpread much, and mount high, and therefore
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100170:98"/> require the aid of tall ſticks, every one knows the worth of them.</p>
                        <p>There is another very large grey, but extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſweet <hi>Peaſe,</hi> that is lately propagated, it is tender but very Fruitful, and deſerves a large Bed in your Kitchin <hi>Garden.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They delight in a warm light Soyl, if it be rich, the <hi>Peaſe</hi> are the fairer, if lean the <hi>Peaſe</hi> are the more early, and ſpend better, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when dry.</p>
                        <p>They are ſet with a Dibble to more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage than ſown in Rills or Furrows, but either way ſhould be by a Line, and the roughs eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen inches or two foot apart, as the ground is in goodneſs, that you may go between them to haw, weed, or gather them.</p>
                        <p>If you keep the ground between them bare, they will ripen the ſooner, for the heat of the ground will contribute much thereto.</p>
                        <p>If you raiſe the Earth about them when they are about a hand breadth high, they will flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh the better.</p>
                        <p>If you ſet or ſow them in the beginning of, or before Winter, you muſt inter twice as many <hi>Peaſe</hi> as you need to do in caſe you ſtay till <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> becauſe the Cold and Mice will deſtroy a part.</p>
                        <p>Ground laid in deep Furrows from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>West,</hi> and <hi>Peaſe</hi> ſown or ſet on the <hi>South</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining ſide of each Furrow, will defend your <hi>Peaſe</hi> better in the Winter, than if they were ſown or ſet on a Level. For on the <hi>Wiltſhire</hi> Plains, the Husbandmen leave their Land af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100170:98"/> it is ſown with Wheat, as rough and clotty as they can, to ſhelter their Corn in Graſs from the ſeverity of the cold Winds in the Winter.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Peaſe</hi> on Sticks will bear more, but on the ground will ripen ſooner.</p>

                        <p>Sow all your <hi>Cabbage</hi> Seeds that you intend for Winter Plants in <hi>Argust,</hi> or beginning of <hi>September,</hi> and when they are grown with Leaves about three Fingers broad then draw them and plant them out in freſh and rich Land, where they may remain all the Winter and at Spring replant them where they are to ſtand for <hi>Cabbages.</hi> Theſe are thoſe they call Leger Plants that produce the faireſt <hi>Cabbages.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You may ſow your Seeds in the Spring, in <hi>March</hi> and <hi>April,</hi> for <hi>Cauls</hi> for the whole Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and ſome of them, if the Year prove

                        <p>At the tranſplanting your young Plants, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them with water that is enriched with dung.</p>
                        <p>Before the great Froſts ſurpriſe you, you may take up your hardeſt <hi>Cabbages,</hi> and after they have hung up by their Roots about a fortnight, to drain the water from them, you may either lay them in ſome Cellar, where they will keep a long time, or Plant them deep in the ground cloſe one to another, and cover them with Hawm or Straw until you have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to uſe them.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe you intend for Seed, you may plant in rich Soil indifferent deep, and cover them from the Froſts, and in the Spring they will quickly aſpire.</p>

                        <p>Their Seeds are ſown in <hi>Auguſt</hi> or <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> on Beds, where they may be defended all the Winter by Mats or other cloſe Shelter to preſerve them from Froſts.</p>
                        <p>In the Spring about the end of <hi>March,</hi> it is a good time to plant them out in Plants where they ſhould ſtand, which in a dripping Spring, or by diligent watering will yield you fair Flowers, but if they are not watered, they will bring forth ragged and divided Flowers.</p>
                        <p>You may Sow their Seed in <hi>February</hi> on a hot Bed, and have Flowers within a Month after thoſe that were Sown before Winter.</p>

                        <p>There are ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Melons,</hi> and called by ſeveral Names, but thoſe moſt uſually known are <hi>the large ribbed Melon,</hi> and the <hi>ſmall round Melon.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>They are ſown in <hi>February</hi> at the full of the Moon in your hot Bed (the making whereof you ſhall find at the end of this Book) the Seeds firſt ſteep'd in Milk twenty four hours, and then ſet two or three in a hole about an inch deep.</p>
                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:100170:101"/>
                        <p> When your Seeds are in the ground, cover up your Bed to preſerve it warm, and when they are come up, then cover them with drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſſes, leaving room for a little Air near the ground.</p>
                        <p>Towards the end of <hi>April</hi> you may remove your <hi>Melon</hi> Plants out of the hot Bed, into the Bed wherein they are to grow all the Summer, which Bed, or at leaſt certain large holes in it, is to be of very rich light Mould; the beſt time for this Work is in an Evening after a fair Day.</p>
                        <p>At their firſt removal they muſt be watred and defended from Sun and Cold, three or four days together, and afterwards from the Cold.</p>
                        <p>When the plants grow large, you may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them either with glaſs Bells made for that purpoſe, or with ſquare Caſes of Glaſs made by the Glaſiers for the ſame uſe. Be ſure keep them cloſe at Night, and give them ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Air under the Glaſs, or at the top in the day time.</p>
                        <p>To prevent Froſts from hurting your Plants, and Hail from breaking your Glaſſes, if you have any forewarning of either, you may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your Glaſſes with peaſe-ſtraw or Mats.</p>
                        <p>When you water your <hi>Melons</hi> (which they expect only in very dry and hot Weather) wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them at half a foot diſtance from the Root and not wet the Leaves.</p>
                        <p>Place a Tile under each <hi>Melon,</hi> it will lie the warmer upon it, and nip off the ſmall
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100170:102"/> ſhoots that exhauſt the ſap from the more lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Branches.</p>
                        <p>Some preſcribe to cover your <hi>Melon</hi> Bed two or three inches with Sand, to increaſe the heat of the Sun by reflection, but Tiles under the Fruit may do as well.</p>
                        <p>Alſo it is adviſed that you ſhelter your new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly removed plant from the heat of the Sun at Noon, and until four in the Afternoon, as well as from the Cold, and that until the plants have gotten Leaves broad enough to cover their Stalks and Roots from the parching Sun.</p>
                        <p>When your <hi>Melons</hi> are as big as Tennis-Balls, then nip off the ſhots at ſome diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them at a Joynt, and the <hi>Melons</hi> will grow large.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Melons</hi> are known to be ripe when the Stalk ſeems as if it would part from the Fruit, when they begin to gild and grow yellow under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, and by their fragrant Odour they yield which increaſeth as they more and more ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</p>
                        <p>But every <hi>Melon</hi> appears not alike in Colour when mature, therefore you muſt conſider their difierent Natures. If they are to carry far, then gather them when they begin to ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, but if they are to ſpend immediately, then let them be through ripe.</p>
                        <p>When you gather your <hi>Melons,</hi> you may put them before they be cut into a Bucket of cold Water, for a minute of time, to refreſh them, which will make them eat cool and pleaſant, and with an excellent Flavour; as
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100170:102"/> it will mend a Bottle of Wine in hot Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>Leave ſome part of the Stalk to the <hi>Melon,</hi> leſt by being broken too near, the <hi>Melon</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and loſe the richneſs of its taſte: Let them not when you gather them be too green, nor over ripe.</p>
                        <p>Preſerve the Seeds of thoſe that are moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ripe, and prefer thoſe Seeds that lodged at the ſunny ſide of the <hi>Melon.</hi>

                        <p>There are two ſorts of them, that is, the <hi>large green Cucumber,</hi> vulgarly called the <hi>Horſe-Cucumber,</hi> which the <hi>French</hi> call <hi>Parroquets.</hi>

                        <p>They are planted aad propagated after the ſame manner as are the <hi>Melons,</hi> only they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire more watring, and withal they are much more hardy.</p>
                        <p>Although watring makes the <hi>Cucumbers</hi> more fruitful, yet they are more pleaſant and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome if they have but little Water.</p>

                        <p>They muſt be planted in Rich old Dung, and require a large place to ramble in, they will lay their Fruit on the Ground, or on Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folds made for that purpoſe, or on Pales or dry Hedges.</p>
                        <p>There are leſſer ſorts of them that are lately <note place="margin">Of Squaſhes.</note> brought into requeſt that are called <hi>Squaſhes,</hi> the edible part whereof boyl'd and ſerv'd up with Powdered Beef is eſteemed a good Sauce.</p>

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:100170:103"/> excellent Summer Sallad, cooling and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and for that uſe hath it been always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated: And although there be ſeveral ſorts of them, yet that one <hi>Cabbage-Lettuce</hi> being the beſt, eaten either raw or boyled, the other may be neglected.</p>
                        <p>They are uſually ſown in <hi>February</hi> and <hi>March,</hi> and unleſs the Weather prove very cold, they will flouriſh and yield you a Spring Sallad in the beginning of <hi>April,</hi> but if defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any good defence, then will they be fit for uſe before that time.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe that are ſown in <hi>March</hi> or <hi>April</hi> in good rich Land will head very well; yet it is ſaid they will head better if tranſplanted whilſt they are young, although ſome are of another opinion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Lettuce</hi> ſown in the Autumn, then tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted and preſerv'd over the Winter, will head in the Spring before any that are ſown and tranſplanted in the Spring.</p>
                        <p>The ſorts of <hi>Lettuce</hi> that are uſually account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are, the <hi>Cabbage, Lumbard, Roman, Arabian, Savoy, Roſe,</hi> Red and Curled <hi>Lettuice.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You may blanch the largeſt <hi>Roman Lettuce</hi> when they are at their full growth, by binding them up with Straw or raw Hemp, or by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering them with Earthen Pots fit to encloſe them, and afterwards heating the Pots with long Dung.</p>
                        <p>

                        <p> It is tender in the Spring, the Froſts uſually nipping it, but rather the drought or ſmall dew Snails, for I have known more than once the Seeds of <hi>Purſlain,</hi> that have been ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly fallen in the Autumn, to flouriſh in the Spring, notwithſtanding the Winter, which indeed was not very ſevere.</p>
                        <p>But to have it early, you may ſow it on the hot Bed, or in <hi>April,</hi> in any rich ſoil finely dreſſed, and after the Seeds are ſown, to clap over the Bed with the back of your Spade, and water it, for it delighteth in moiſture.</p>
                        <p>If it be ſown thin, or tranſplanted apart, it will yield you fair Plants, either for Seed, or to pickle, or to boyl.</p>
                        <p>When the Seed looks very black, then ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſtalks and lay them abroad in the Sun, which will the better maturate the Seed; lay them on a Board or Cloth to preſerve them from ſpilling and houſe them in the night, and expoſe them in the day until they are ripe.</p>
                        <p>It is ſaid that the Seed of three or four years old is better than the new.</p>

                        <p>THere are ſome Plants, Herbs, or parts of them, that are Eſculent either of themſelves, or in Condiments, that are not uſually propagated in <hi>Gardens</hi> for that purpoſe, as the young Buds of Hops boyl'd do much reſemble <hi>Aſparagus</hi> in the eating, and are very pleaſant and wholeſome where the other are not to be had; the young ſhoots of a new lopp'd <hi>Elder-Tree</hi> being boyl'd are eſteem'd a moſt excellent Diſh; the ordinary Buds of <hi>Elder,</hi> and the red young tops of Nettles, and of <hi>Water-creſſes,</hi> and alſo of <hi>Brook-lime,</hi> every Herb-woman can tell you are good Spring <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads</hi> or <hi>Pottage-herbs.</hi>

                        <p>The green tops of <hi>young Peaſe</hi> cut off and boyl'd are reported to be a moſt delicate Diſh, <hi>quaere,</hi> Whether if they being cut off, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Roots will not emit new ſhoots, and produce a fair Crop of later Peaſe; If they will, then may you have late Peaſe better this way than by ſowing late.</p>

                           <hi>Champignons, Muſhromes,</hi> or <hi>Mouſſerons,</hi> have <note place="margin">Muſhromes.</note> been ever reputed a dainty Diſh, in the choice and preparing of which the ancient <hi>Romans</hi> took a great delight. Yet then were ſeveral Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons poyſoned with the uſe of ſuch of them, that were of a venomous nature, and in theſe colder Climates ſome ſorts of them are not much to be confided in.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe that are edible here with us, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Muſhromes</hi> of the <hi>Woods,</hi> and grow by the Borders of <hi>Woods</hi> and <hi>Foreſts,</hi> and are very large; or <hi>Muſhromes</hi> of the <hi>Meadows</hi> and ſweet <hi>Paſtures,</hi> which grow frequently where Cattel feed, which uſually flouriſh in the <hi>Autumn,</hi> and are moſt eſteem'd, becauſe of their Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and whiteneſs above, and Vermilion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, having alſo a pleaſant Scent with them.</p>
                        <p>It is ſaid that you may raiſe <hi>Muſhromes</hi> in Beds in your <hi>Gardens,</hi> by preparing a Bed with the Soil of <hi>Mules</hi> or <hi>Aſſes,</hi> and covering it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver four Fingers thick with rich Dung, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it hath laid a while to cool, then to caſt on it the parings and refuſe of <hi>Muſhromes,</hi> and old rotten <hi>Muſhromes</hi> with the Water uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, and in a ſhort time your Bed will produce them.

                        </p>
                        <p>It is probable that theſe, though unperfect Plants, may have a Seed, which ſown in an apt place may produce others of the ſame Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>

                           <p>HAving thus briefly given you a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of ornamental, as well as uſeful Parts and Materials for your ſeveral <hi>Gardens,</hi> and the ſpecifical ways of preparing, ordering, and managing of the various Plants, Flowers, and other Curioſities uſually grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, it now remains that ſomething be ſaid as to the more general manner of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving your Ground, and preparing of Dungs, Soils, and Compoſts proper for your uſe, and making of hot Beds, with many other things neceſſary to be known by ſuch that delight in the improvement of <hi>Hortulans.</hi>

                           <p>Of the general mixtures of the Earth the one with the other, to qualifie their Natures by adding that of a contrary, I have before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed.
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100170:109"/> Of the preparation of Earth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch mixtures, Sir <hi>Hugh Platt</hi> hath given you an Aenigmatical Deſcription, calling it his <hi>Philoſophical Garden;</hi> his Precept is, <q rend="inline">To pave a ſquare Plot with Brick (if covered with Plaiſter of <hi>Paris</hi> the better) making up the ſides of Brick alſo, plaiſtred likewiſe; let it be of a convenient depth, fill it with the beſt vegetative <hi>Saturn</hi> which you can get, that hath ſtood two years, or one at the leaſt, quite within his own Sphere, make contriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſame; and be ſure to avoid all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, imbibe it with <hi>Aqua Coeleſtis</hi> in a true proportion: grind it once a day till it be dry; being dry, let it ſtand two or three days without any imbibition, that it may the better attract from all heavenly influence, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing then alſo a Philoſophical Contrition e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, (this grinding muſt alſo be uſed in the vegetable works, where the Mercury of Herbs is uſed inſtead of <hi>Aqua Coeleſtis)</hi> during all the time of preparation: Then plant what rare Flowers, Fruits, or Seeds, you pleaſe therein; the ſame Philoſopher then tells you, That (if his Theory of Nature deceive him not) that <hi>Saturn</hi> ſo enriched from the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, without the help of any manner of Soil, Marl, or Compoſt (after one years re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution) will make the ſame to flouriſh and fructifie in a ſtrange and admirable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>By his Vegetable <hi>Saturn</hi> may be underſtood, ſuch Earth that is moſt prone to ſend forth
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100170:109"/> Plants; by its ſtanding ſo long within its own Sphere, is only that it hath been covered ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther naturally by Turf, or artificially by Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or ſuch like, that it hath been prevented from waſting its ſoecund Nature, by ſending forth or bearing Vegetables. The beſt of ſuch reſted fruitful Earth, is to be put in what quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity you pleaſe into your Brick or Stone Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern (being made proportionable) but not too deep leſt it hinder you from ſtirring the Earth to the bottom, and will not permit it to dry ſo eaſily, this muſt be reduced to a fineneſs; therefore it would not be amiſs to let it paſs the Sieve or Screen before you put it in your Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern. The imbibition of this Earth with <hi>Aqua Coeleſtis</hi> can be no other than with Rain-water, which is exhaled by the influence of the Sun, and in the Air attracteth a volatile Nitre, which deſcending with the Rain on the dry Earth is ſoon imbibed again; this volatile Spirit or Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre that thus ariſeth in ſo great a quantity, is that <hi>Spiritus Mundi</hi> that cauſeth all Vegetation, and wherewith the Air it ſelf is filled, and by ſeveral ways coagulated, and by the often irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating the Earth with it, the Earth is the more fertilized: But this way of continuing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, or ſtirring it every day to dry it, makes the Earth much eaſier to attract the Water, which being added in a true or ſo little a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, that it may not wet but moiſten only, the Earth will leave its nitrous or vegetating Vertue behind it, when the Phlegmatick part fumes away again by the ſtirring of the Earth,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:100170:110"/> which if it were added in too great a quantity would exhauſt the nitrous Spirit that was before in the Earth. For it is a general Obſervation amongſt Philoſophers, that as the greater over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powereth the leſſer, ſo if the matter you add be volatile, and greater in proportion than that which is fixt, it is apt to volatilize that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was fixt, being added unto it: And on the contrary, that if the volatile matter be leſs in proportion than the fixt, to which you add it, then is that which is fixt apt to fix the volatile: Therefore did our Author wiſely add, that the imbibition ſhould be made in a true proportion, which is, that the Rain-water ſhould be only for an eaſie Humectation, and not too great a wetting; then he tells you, that it ſhould ſtand two or three days without any imbibition, that is, between every humectation the Earth ſhould be throughly dryed as the Air or Wind can dry it, which will take up ſuch a ſpace of time, notwithſtanding your daily ſtirring it; for the drier any open terreſtrial Matter is, it doth not only the more eaſily attract, but more perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixeth that which otherwiſe would be more volatile; although our Author hath not given caution of it, yet it is preſumed that the ſquare Plot or Ciſtern he preſcribes ſhould be covered or defended from the Sun, which by his Rays is apt to attract much of the <hi>Spiritus Mundi,</hi> or Matter of Vegetables, where there is plenty unfixt; as is evident from the various Smells that are exhaled by it, and Colours alſo much ſooner faded by the Sun-beams than by the heat
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100170:110"/> of Fire; and alſo from the Rain which in great Showers is apt to over-moiſten it, and in continued Rains, to prevent its drying; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your Rain-water ſhould be kept in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern made for that purpoſe, where the longer it remains the better it will prove; ſuch Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue always encreaſeth whilſt it is in its proper Matrix, as appeareth by Urine kept long, which yieldeth much more Spirit than whilſt it is new.</p>
                           <p>By the Author's ſaying that this grinding is to be uſed in the Vegetable-work, where the Mercury of Herbs is uſed inſtead of <hi>Aqua Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtis;</hi> it's probable here he means the expreſs'd Juice of green Vegetables, which virtually hath in it the matter of Vegetables, and may have the ſame effect on the Earth in a ſmall quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and little time, as the Rain-water hath in a greater quantity by the long continuation of the Operation.</p>
                           <p>This way of contrition, imbibition, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulation, enricheth the Earth after the ſame manner, by covering it many years with Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by which means Salt-petre is increaſed: only by this Operation you may effect your Deſign in one year with labour and diligence, which there you muſt wait many years for: And by this may you heighten the Vertue of your Soil to a far higher degree, it being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual, than the other which is nutural, and will not exceed the ordinary Bounds limited in this Climate.</p>
                           <pb n="200" facs="tcp:100170:111"/>
                           <p> That our Author's <hi>Saturn</hi> is our natural and common Earth, and his <hi>Aqua Coeleſtis,</hi> Rain-water, may be concluded from his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, uſed in the ſame Deſcription of his <hi>Philoſophical Garden,</hi> which are, <q rend="inline">That if the Earth it ſelf after it hath thus conceived from the Clouds, were then left to bring forth her own Fruits and Flowers in her own time, and no Seeds or Plants placed therein by the hand of Man, it is held very probable, that this heavenly Earth ſo manured with the Stars, would bring forth ſtrange and glorious Fruits and Flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                              </q> Which is not improbable, if we conſider the fertility of the Waters of <hi>Nile,</hi> which are firſt exhauſted in thoſe hotter <hi>African</hi> Regions, by the power of the Sun's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence (when in a due Latitude) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed by the Air far more fruitful, as well as the Earth, in Nitre there, than in theſe cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Regions, yielding that great and fertile Flood, whoſe precipitate or ſetling Slime ſo far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richeth the dried and thirſty Earth, that it not only ſpontaneouſly produceth abundance of Vegetables but Animals alſo.</p>
                           <p>I know no reaſon but by obſerving our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Direction in this Climate, a diligent O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perator may advance the Vertue of our Earth to the ſame degree or greater, than the <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Soil, and then may it anſwer his Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in producing ſuch Rarities, that by no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ways are here attainable; for if any Man would advance or improve Nature, he muſt tread in Nature's Steps, and trace her to the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:100170:111"/> Foundation. Next unto this extraordinary improvement of Earth by labour without any other mixture than Earth and Rain-water, which many will not experiment, becauſe of the length of time required in it, you may fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the Operation by often ſtirring or dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging your Land, and reducing it to a fineneſs by skreening it, which alſo is a means to cleanſe it from Weeds, Stones, Worms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noy your tender Plants; by reiterating of which Work you expoſe the Earth thus open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Air, Froſt, Snow and Rain, and capacitate it to receive the benign Influences of the Heavens, and prevent the exhauſting of the nitrous Spirit by the growth of any Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables in it. This Operation the longer you continue it the better, the time for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it is not material, ſo that you let it receive the effects of both extream Seaſons: like unto this are your fallowings of Land for ſeveral Grains, eſpecially the fallowings and twi-fallowings for Wheat, long before the laſt plowing at the Seed-time, and in ſeveral caſes a contrition or dragging after the fallowings, which proves a conſiderable improvement of ſtiff Land. Thus may you ſee how Nature is improved by Induſtry only, and that but by treading in her own Steps; for Earth often trod on by Men or Beaſts in the Streets or High-ways is very much enriched by ſuch expoſure, and Earth defended from the Sun and Air, in like manner becomes fertile, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though from different Cauſes, the former
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100170:112"/> from the volatile Nitre, and other Influences in the Air, Rain and Snow, the latter from the Condenſation of the <hi>Spiritus Mundi,</hi> or ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Breathings of the Earth, and both by reaſon that thoſe fertile Qualities are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by Vegetation.</p>
                           <p>But as this latter Operation is more facile than the former, ſo you cannot expect that it ſhould produce Effects anſwerable to the other, which is very much to be preferr'd by ſuch that are curious; although this latter way may yield you a ſufficient Recompence for your Labour, yet the former cannot but far tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend it.</p>

                           <p>IT is without queſtion that Earth or Mould is to be made more fertile than naturally it is, by mixing therewith ſeveral Materials that contain in them much of the vegetating Spirit, as the Aſhes of any manner of burnt Vegetables. For by ſuch burning is waſted the more phlegmatick and uſeleſs moiſture, and are fix'd the more ſolid and ſubſtantial parts: The ſame effect hath Fire on the Turf, or rooty ſurface of the Earth; this ſmegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick or oily Matter that is left by the Fire, in
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:100170:112"/> a moderate proportion applyed to any Earth highly enricheth it, and makes it apt for fructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, as appeareth by the vulgar Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Burn-beating of Land, which yieldeth ſo fair Crops of Wheat and other Grain. In which Operation the Ruſtick obſerves, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-burning the Turf is injurious, and that a more moderate burning maketh the Ground more fertile. The Reaſon is plain; for in the burning of any Vegetable, a gentle, eaſie, and ſmothering Fire doth not waſte the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile nitrous Spirit ſo much as a quick, but cauſeth much more of it to fix and remain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind.</p>
                           <p>Theſe fixed Salts that are thus obtained, are the principal Salts that are ſo much celebrated for the Improvements of Earth, to render it more fruitful, although there are many other Salts near in affinity to theſe, that do in ſome degree meliorate Earth, as the Salts that are in <hi>Blood, Urine, Soot,</hi> and ſeveral other things of the like nature, by the mixture of thoſe Materials with the Earth, or ſprinkling it with them, whereby the Rains uſually car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry down their Vertue to the Roots of your Plants.</p>

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:100170:113"/> is in old woollen Rags, in fertilizing Land for Corn, giving ten times the price for a load of them to lay on their Corn-ground, that they will for a Load of Dung, and are yet great gainers by it, and fetch them from near <hi>London</hi> into <hi>Hertfordſhire</hi> into the Bargain: <hi>Wooll, Hair,</hi> and <hi>Feathers,</hi> are near of a nature, and therefore have near the ſame effects.</p>

                              <hi>Horns, Hoofs,</hi> and <hi>Skins,</hi> contain in them much of a rich volatile Salt; and it hath been anciently obſerved, and in ſuch Countries where naturally the ground is more replete with Nitre, and more fertile than here, that theſe Materials have very much fertilized <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-</hi>ground, eſpecially for the <hi>Aſparagus,</hi> that requires ſtrong nouriſhment; therefore the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings or odd pieces of Horn, and the leſſer Horns and the Hoofs, and other excrementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious parts of Beaſts, at the common Slaughter-houſes may be obtain'd, to make your deep Beds for <hi>Aſparagus, Artichoaks,</hi> and ſuch like, and may not be unuſeful in enriching your Ground for your choiceſt Flowers.</p>

                           <p>Take Sheeps Dung and put Water to it, <note place="margin">Of Sheeps Dung.</note> (in ſome Veſſel) ſo much as by ſtirring may reduce it to a Pap, and when it is all through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſſolved, mix ſome fine ſifted Earth with it; let the Earth be four, five, or ſix times more in quantity than the Sheeps Dung, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the Earth is in goodneſs: If it be a poor ſandy Earth, the more of the Sheeps Dung it requires to enrich it; if it be a ſtiff Ground, the more it requires to make it light, but an indifferent mellow Earth requires the leſs; for Sheeps Dung is one of the richeſt of Dungs, as may be obſerved from the great improvement that is made by Flocks of Sheep being folded on the poor champion Lands, where ſuch Land yields much Corn, when not being ſo improved, it will yield but little, and this from one only folding in ſeveral Months, or ſometimes in a whole Year toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Deer and Goats Dung are much of the ſame nature with Sheeps Dung. The reaſon
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:100170:114"/> of which extraordinary fertility in that Soyl is from the well chewing the Food, the long continuance in the Body, and the not (or but little) drinking of the Beaſt. For Sheep and Neat chew the Cud, by which means their Food is made fine, both theſe (and ſo do Deer and Goats) retain their Meat longer than Horſes or Swine, who feed more groſly and haſtily, the Dung of the one being like whiſps of Hay, of the other like a mixture of all ſorts of Filth. Alſo <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Deer</hi> drink but little, which make their Dung and their U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine (which alſo is very rich could it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved) very fertile. <hi>Neat</hi> drink much, which very much tempereth and allayeth the heat and fertile Nature of the Soyl.

Therefore you may well conclude, that theſe Dungs laid in a heap in the open Air, and moiſtned by the Rain, or otherwiſe, until their heat is over, will make a moſt rich Compoſt for either <hi>Garden,</hi> but more eſpecially for your Kitchen <hi>Garden.</hi>

                           <p>That Water is very good that is taken out of ſtanding Pools, where Cattel uſually reſort to ſhade or cool themſelves in hot Weather, and leave their Dung in it, which by the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their Feet enricheth the Water; Ducks and Geeſe alſo much improve ſtanding Pools where they frequent.</p>
                           <p>Several Waters may be prepared, in which you may ſteep or macerate your Seeds or Pulſe, to make them ſprout the ſooner, or come the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100170:117"/> fairer, and with the ſame Water may you ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigate your Ground: Many Receipts there are to that end, I ſhall only mention ſome of them.</p>
                           <p>Take Sheeps Dung well diſſolved in warm Water, and after it hath ſtood twelve Hours, ſtrain it through a courſe Cloth with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, for it is ſo ſlimy that it comes through with difficulty; therefore I ſuppoſe a Decan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation may ſerve. To two or three Gallons of this Liquor add a handful of Bay-ſalt, and ſomewhat a leſſer proportion of Salt-petre, and let them both be diſſolved in the former Water, which to expedite, let it be made luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm, and ſtirred often; in which Liquor let your Seeds lie for twenty four hours or more, till they are throughly ſwelled; Pulſe need not lie ſo long: Then take out your Seeds or Pulſe, and expoſe them thinly on ſome Floor to the Air, (not the Sun) until they be half dry, then ſow them. It is alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, that the remainder of the Sheeps Dung that was not made liquid, ſhould be dried and calcined, and the fix'd Salt extracted out of it, and added to the former Compoſition; but it's more probable that another parcel of Sheeps Dung calcined, would yield more and better Salt, than the remaining part of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved Dung. This latter part makes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs too difficult and troubleſom, and adds but little to the vertue of it, any other fixed Salt having the ſame effect as that ſo hard to be obtained.</p>
                           <pb n="213" facs="tcp:100170:117"/>
                           <p> This Liquor is more effectual for the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of Plants, than it is for the maceration of Seeds; and ſo are any other ſalt Waters. Some add a greater quantity of Salt-petre, and Bay-ſalt; ſome only Salt-petre; others uſe Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons Dung in ſtead of Sheeps Dung; alſo Lime-water after that manner enrich'd with Sheeps Dung, Pigeons Dung, or Neats Dung, is equal in vertue, if not exceeding that, to which Salt-petre or Bay-ſalt is added. Every Husbandman hath experimented the Effect of Lime, the Salt only extracted by the Rains enriching the Earth, occaſioning ſo plentiful a Crop, the other remaining part like a <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> only tempereth the Land for the future, and maketh it more ſad where before it was too light, which if the Land did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire it, then doth Lime (after its Salt is waſted) much injury to the Land whereon it is laid.</p>
                           <p>Nitre or Salt-petre only, diſſolv'd in Water, a Pound to four or five Gallons, is held to be very effectual to enrich barren Mould. This agrees with our Obſervations about Earth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with Building, or otherwiſe defended from Sun and Rain, for the generation of Nitre.</p>
                           <p>Some commend the ſprinkling of Milk and Rain-water on the Beds, firſt ſifted over with Lime pulverized, whether by pounding or ſlacking with Water it mattereth not, (neither of which can improve or abate the vertue or quantity of its Salt, the thing we deſire) and after every Watering ſifting more Lime. This
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:100170:118"/> way may not be amiſs for ſuch Lands, that the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of the Lime remaining af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Salt is extracted, will not prejudice, and for ſuch Plants that the Lime lying on the Ground will not injure. The Milk may be left out, not ſignifying ſo much as the value of it amounts unto; the Liquor wherein Fleſh Meats (whether Freſh or Salt) have been boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, is much better, and eaſier obtained. The Salt of Lime (extracted with Water in ſome large wooden Veſſel) containeth in it the ſame improving Vertue, and is leſs troubleſom to make uſe of, and free from the Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences that attend the other way.</p>
                           <p>Much more might be ſaid concerning theſe improving Liquids as well as Solids; but that the moſt learned and experienc'd of Rural or <note place="margin">Mr <hi>Evelyn.</hi>
                              </note> Hortulane Authors hath lately been very co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious on the ſame Subject.</p>
                           <p>Only I may here adviſe the unexperienced not to water his Plants in either <hi>Garden</hi> with a cold Spring or Well-water, if he can obtain any other; which if he cannot, then to expoſe this to the Sun or Air, ſome time before he uſeth it, or enrich it by ſome pinguid Mixtures, as Lime, Aſhes, Dung, or ſuch like, which will quickly qualifie it for his purpoſe, by abating the ſudden Coldneſs of it to the Plant: For it is a very great Injury to moſt tender Plants, to be diluted with cold Water from the Well or Spring, and checks their Growth exceedingly, as may be obſerved in a bleeding Vine, to the naked Roots of which if you pour ſtore of cold
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:100170:118"/> Spring or Well-water, it ſuddenly checks the aſcenſion of the Sap, by means whereof the Bleeding ceaſeth, and the Wound conſolidates again, before the more liberal aſcent of the Sap, much more then will it check the Growth of a weak Herb or Flower.</p>
                           <p>Alſo as it is obſerved to ſow in the Duſt, whereby the Seeds gradually ſwell from the cold Dews of the Night and Air, and are made ready to ſprout with the next Rains; ſo it is not good to water new-ſown Seeds, until the long defect of Showers invite you to it, leſt you waſh off the Earth from them before they have ſprouted, whereby they faſten themſelves the better to endure a Watering: Some Seeds, as <hi>Radiſh, Lettuce, Gilliflower-ſeed,</hi> &amp;c. remain not long in the Earth, and therefore may in two or three Days, for want of Rain, be watered by hand; but <hi>Tulip, Auricula, Parſley, Carrot-ſeed, &amp;c.</hi> lie longer in the Ground, and require not ſo ſpeedy an Irrigation.</p>
                           <p>All Seed ought to be watered by the ſmalleſt or Rain-like Drops as you can, and not too much; for haſty Watering, and haſty Showers, diſcover them.</p>
                           <p>For moſt Flowers and Plants whoſe Leaves lie near the Ground, it is beſt to water them at ſome diſtance, by making a Ring round the Plant a little hollow, and pouring the Water into it, whereby you annoy not the Leaves with your diſcolouring Water, or chill them with the Coldneſs of it.</p>
                           <pb n="216" facs="tcp:100170:119"/>
                           <p> In all warm Weather the Evening is the beſt Seaſon to water in, becauſe the Water will have time to ſink into the Earth, and the Plant to attract it, before the Heat of the Sun exhales it; but in cold Weather, and when the Nights are cold, the Morning is the moſt proper time that the ſuperfluous Moiſture may be evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before the cold Night overtake you, and chill your Plant.</p>

                           <p>To water your Flower-pot, that the Water <note place="margin">Watering of Flower-pots.</note> may the eaſier deſcend to the bottom, and throughout the whole Pot, you may before

The Water you uſe here ought to be meliora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome of the former ways: For Earth thus ſeparated from the Ground, is more apt to decay, than that which is remaining on its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Foundation, which continually receives an Improvement, by perſpiration of the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating Spirit.</p>

This Cover is made to take off and on, to cleanſe, at pleaſure.</p>
                           <p>There is another ſort of Watering-pot that hath a ſmall Hole at the bottom, and another at the top; ſo that when you ſink it into a Veſſel of Water, it will fill by the lower Pipe or Hole, the Air paſſing out at the Hole at the top, where the Handle is alſo: When it is
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:100170:120"/> full take it by the Handle, and ſtop the Hole with your Thumb, and when you come to the Plant you intend to water, you may eaſe the Hole whereon your Thumb lies, and as you pleaſe let the Water out at the Pipe in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; for as the Air comes in at the top, the Water will iſſue out at the bottom; and ſo may you ſtop it, and open it with your Thumb at your pleaſure: With this Pot you may eaſily let the Water down on your Plants that can bear with a waſhing Shower.</p>
                           <p>You may water any Ground by the firſt ſort of Watering-pot, with any enriched or thick Water, if you take off the Cover of the Pipe, and convey the ſame Water about the Roots of any Plants, without fouling the Leaves or Flowers.</p>
                           <p>Alſo you may have a ſmall Engine made like one of the Engines for the raiſing of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to extinguiſh Fire withal, and place it in a Frame to drive to and fro about your <hi>Garden;</hi> you may fill it with Water, and the Spout or Pipe with a perforated Cover, like unto the common Watering-pots (but not ſo broad as to ſpread the Water ſo much) with this Engine may you imitate Rain over any of your Beds at a diſtance, and waſh your Wall-trees from Vermine, and refreſh them at your pleaſure.</p>

                           <p>IT is evident to all, that moſt Plants do na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally obſerve the Seaſon of the Year in their Germination, Growth, and Maturation; and although they are removed into another Climate, yet do they incline to the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſame Time as they did in their own former natural Place of their Growth, as the <hi>Perſian Iris, American Strawberry,</hi> and ſeveral others, which make them the more acceptable as they come earlier or later than others of the ſame Kind. So is it with many other Flowers, Fruits, or Herbs: For we annually obſerve how acceptable a Diſh of early Peaſe is, over what they are when later and common; and ſo are <hi>Aſparagus, Cucumbers, Melons,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                           <p>The Growth of moſt Plants is quickned by a warm Poſition, as under a warm Fence or Wall, and by an artificial Heat, as by being planted againſt a Place where Fire is uſually kept, or by watering them with Waters impregnated by hot Dungs, which will very much accelerate Germination.</p>

                           <p>But the Hot-beds that are moſt uſeful, and whereon you are to raiſe your tender Exoticks, and your early Flowers; and alſo to raiſe and bring forward your <hi>Melons, Cucumbers, Cauly-flowers,</hi> &amp;c. is uſually made in <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March,</hi> and after ſeveral manners.</p>
                           <p>Some preſcribe the making of it, by laying of hot Stable-dung that hath lain in a Heap, mixing the neweſt with the old, and laying it about four Foot broad, the better to preſerve its warmth; three, four, or five Foot high, and as long as you have Occaſion or Materials. This Bed well trod (to excite the Heat) is to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered about four Inches thick with very fine rich Mould, the top and ſides of the Bed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firſt edged round with Board or Bands of twiſted Hay or Straw, to keep up the Mould, and keep in the Heat: Thus muſt it lie until it hath paſſed its greateſt Heat, which you may prove by your Finger; for it ought to be but warm, not hot. In caſe its Heat leſſeneth at
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:100170:121"/> any time, you may encreaſe it by applying new Dung to the ſides of your Bed; on this may you ſow your Seeds.</p>
                           <p>There muſt be ſome Frame arch-wiſe, or flat, over this Hot-bed, that a Covering of Mats or Straw Hurdles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be ſpread over it every Night, and in cold Days: Make your Covering ſo that it may as well keep out the Rain and Snow, as the Wind.</p>
                           <p>But the beſt Deſcription of a Hot-bed, is that of Mr. <hi>Evelyn</hi> in his late Philoſophical Diſcourſe of Earth, to this Effect; Dig a Pit about four Foot deep, of breadth and length as your Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions require; wall this Pit on every ſide with Brick, or erect your Wall above the Ground, or part above, and part under; then fill it with hot Dung from the Stable, and tread it well. In this place wooden Caſes of about a Foot in depth, bored full of Auger-holes at the bottom; fill them with Earth rich and light, and add hot Dung between them; in which Caſes ſow your Seeds, and theſe Caſes and the Earth in them will be kept warm by this means during the whole Seaſon wherein a Hot-bed is neceſſary. You may provide a Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter againſt Rain and Cold over the whole, if you pleaſe; and you may have Frames of Glaſs over ſome of your inſide Caſes where there is moſt need; others you may leave open, as your Seeds require. By this means have you your Pit and Caſes every Year ready to your hand, requiring only a Supply of freſh Dung.</p>

Therefore removing of Plants, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of the Soil, is a good way to improve them; ſeveral Eſculents grow the fairer; as <hi>Cabbages</hi> will not loave well in caſe the young Plants be not three or four times removed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Spring. The ſame is obſerved in <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuce,</hi> and ſeveral others. If they are removed into improved Earth every time, they will eat more tender and better.</p>
                              <p>Flowers are in more eſteem when they come early, than when they come late: To make them early, the Means are generally known; but the retarding of their flowering, often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving, <note place="margin">To make Plants come late.</note> and preventing the uſual excitements of the Sun and Air, will effect; for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:100170:122"/> the Roots in the removal is a great hinderance to their attraction of Nouriſhment, and it will be ſeveral Days after the removal before new Fibres will ſhoot forth to gather new Nouriſhment; and the ſtanding of a Plant prevents the Digeſtion of the Sap by the Heat of the Sun and Air. This is of great uſe in retarding the flowering of ſeveral Flowers, and alſo the growth of ſeveral Eſculents, as <hi>Cauly-flowers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>It is uſual to defend ſeveral tender Plants <note place="margin">Plants to defend from Cold and Sun.</note> from the Cold in the Winter, to preſerve them; and to expoſe them to the Sun in ſuch Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Days that prove clear; which Expoſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jureth the Plant more than the Cold. For the Sun-beams in froſly Weather, eſpecially if there be Snow on the Ground, makes a Plant faint and ſick: As is obſerved in the Laurel, which if it grow againſt a <hi>North</hi> Wall, or in the Shade, although open to the ſevereſt Winds, yet retains its green Colour all the Winter; but if it ſtand in the Sun, it changeth yellow, only from that cauſe. The ſame is obſerved of ſeveral tender Plants that are uſually ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from the Winds, and expoſed to the Sun, yet it is not improper to give Plants Air, and alſo Sun, in mild Weather, at any time of the Winter, which cannot hurt them.</p>
                              <p>The cutting off of the Buds and Branches <note place="margin">Often cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Plants.</note> of Flowers, leaving only one, or two, or more as the ſtrength of the Root will bear, cauſeth it to yield the fairer Flowers than otherwiſe it would do: After the ſame manner if Herbs be
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100170:123"/> often cut, they gather the more ſtrength, yield the fairer Leaf, and take better Root, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Winter the better. The Cauſe is, that the Sap hath leſs to nouriſh, and that which is nouriſhed muſt therefore be the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and the leſs the Sap is expended above, the more ſtrengthens the Root in the Ground, as may be obſerved in moſt Trees that are lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped: And then do they afterwards iſſue forth the faireſt Branches. Some Plants uſually pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in the Winter, for want of being cut in the Summer precedent, and from the ſame Cauſe, as <hi>Wall-flowers, Thyme, Marjoram,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>Some Plants are too apt to waſte their Sap <note place="margin">Plants to continue long.</note> in Flowers, and thereby ſhorten their Lives, as <hi>Gilly-flowers, Stock-Gilly-flowers,</hi> and ſome others, which if their blowing Shoots were nipt off, they would gather ſtrength, and continue lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for the waſte of the Sap overmuch, makes the Plant feeble, and uncapable of enduring any Severity of Winter or Summer, as is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times obſerved in young Fruit-trees, that they bloſſom themſelves to death; and ſome I have known to grow themſelves to death; for the freer the Sap is in expending it ſelf in Branch and Bloſſom, the more tender is the Root, which becomes a Prey to the Worm and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, as doth the Branch to the ſevere Air. The way to prevent which, is preſcribed in the laſt mentioned Experiment.</p>
                              <p>It is obſerved, that all Herbs wax ſweeter, <note place="margin">To melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Plants</note> both in ſmell and taſte, if after often cutting you take the latter ſprouts, becauſe the Sap is
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100170:123"/> the longer digeſted, and the Root the ſtronger. The ſame is obſerved of Eſculents, the young Buds or Sprouts of old Roots eat more tender than the firſt Cuttings.</p>
                              <p>My Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ſeem'd to approve of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion <note place="margin">Onions large.</note> that <hi>Onions</hi> wax greater, if they be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Earth, and laid a drying twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days, and then ſet again. And the more, if the outmoſt Pill be taken off all over, but mentions not at what time of its growth this is beſt to be done; however it is a ſufficient en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement for <hi>Gardeners</hi> to take up the <hi>Oni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> where they caſually come up too thick, and plant them in thinner places. Several Plants are ſo removed, as <hi>Turnips, Lettuce,</hi> &amp;c. and are the fairer, therefore this Obſervation may be of uſe.</p>
                              <p>Sift Aſhes, or Quick-lime beaten ſmall, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <note place="margin">To preſerve Plants from Snails and Worms.</note> any Plant, and it will preſerve it from Snails or Worms, by reaſon their naked Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies cannot endure the ſharpneſs of the Salt of the Aſhes or Lime. So if you water the Ground with the Water wherein Lime or Aſhes have been ſteeped, the Worms will ſoon leave the Ground, where the Water gets into their Holes, from the ſame Cauſe. You may alſo in a Summer Evening (after Rain) with a Candle draw the Worms as they lie on the Ground, and put them in a Pail, and diſpoſe of them as you think fit; but you muſt tread ſoft, for the leaſt motion of the Ground maketh them retire into the Ground. Thus in two or three moiſt Evenings may you clear a whole Border
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100170:124"/> of the greater Worms which are moſt hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
                              <p>Snails and Worms are all of them of an Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maphroditical nature, and are all Breeders, and when they couple are eaſily deſtroyed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the Snails, who couple from the Spring until Midſummer and after. And lay their Eggs in the Ground, you will find them with their Bodies buried in the warm Duſt, and only their Shells above the Ground; when you take them out, you muſt rake out their Eggs and deſtroy them, for otherwiſe they will lie there until they have ſtrength to travel, and then, ſome in the ſame Year, others in the Spring following, you will have them diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongſt your tender Plants, and your Wall-Trees, where after a Shower you may pick them off.</p>
                              <p>If you doubt of the goodneſs of your Seeds, <note place="margin">To know good Seeds.</note> take ſome of them and put them in fair Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſet them in a gentle heat twenty four hours, and if they are good they will ſprout, elſe not. Alſo you may waſh your Seeds in Water, and the dead and light will ſwim, and the good and heavy will ſink; but they muſt be all throughly immerged, elſe you may be deceived.</p>
                              <p>Secure the Root as well as you can from the <note place="margin">To defend Plants from Froſt.</note> Froſt; for if you defend that, the Branch ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſuffers, but if the Root be not ſecured, although the Branch be never ſo well defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it will periſh. Therefore earth up the Roots as well as you can, and place any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:100170:124"/> defence about the ſides of the Plant, and no Froſt will hurt it, (unleſs it be your tender Plants that are for the Conſervatory.) Thus may <hi>Gillyflowers, Wall-flowers, Stock-Gillyflowers, Artichoaks,</hi> &amp;c. be preſerved.</p>
                              <p>Some Plants, if the Roots ſtand dry, the <note place="margin">Set tender Plants dry.</note> Froſts rarely hurt them; which if moiſt, they are uſually deſtroyed, as <hi>Roſemary, Sage, Wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowers,</hi> &amp;c. Either of theſe will grow on a Wall, and endure the ſevereſt Colds, but if they ſtand in a moiſt Ground, although the Branches be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>ever ſo well defended, they are apt to be deſtroyed with great Froſts. The cauſe is, that Water or Moiſture ſtagnating a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any Plant, and a Froſt following, is apt to mortifie it, when a Froſt ſhall ſcarce injure a dry Plant. It is the ſame with young and tender Fruits, a froſty Night after a wet Day deſtroys more Fruits, than ten dry Froſts can do.</p>
                              <p>If you lay Saw-duſt about any Plant, it will <note place="margin">To defend your Plants from Ants.</note> defend it from the buſie Ants, who cannot ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily paſs over the Saw-duſt, becauſe it is ſmall and looſe under them, that they cannot have any ſure footing, and ſo by that means are forced to ſteer their courſe another way. Thus may you defend your Wall-Trees from Ants, by laying Saw-duſt about the Roots of them.</p>
                              <p>Some anoint the Stems of their Trees with Tar, to prevent the Ants from aſcending them, but then it is beſt to bind Paper about the Stems, and anoint the Paper, for Tar is apt to injure the Bark of your Tree.</p>
                              <pb n="228" facs="tcp:100170:125"/>
                              <p> Alſo you may bind about the Stem of the Tree, Wooll about four Fingers breadth, which will puzzle the Ants to find a way over, or through it: be ſure to leave the Wooll rough, that they may not find a way over the Threds you bind it withal.</p>
                              <p>Many of your Flower-Trees will in ſome <note place="margin">Moſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy.</note> ſorts of Land, by long ſtanding, become moſſy, which not only defaceth but very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jureth the Tree, and it is a ſign the Tree di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlikes the Ground it ſtands in. To prevent the growing of it, and the encreaſing of it whilſt it is yet but newly infected, you muſt remove your Tree into better Ground more natural to it, or in caſe you are willing to have it ſtand in the ſame place where now it is, then you muſt take it up, and alter the Ground, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich it as it ought to be, and then you may replant the Tree in the ſame place. And as the Tree thrives and encreaſeth in Shoots, ſo the Moſs will decline, the Sap being waſted and expended more liberally another way.</p>
                              <p>But if the Moſs hath long continued on the Tree, your beſt way is after Rain, that the Moſs be wet and will eaſily come off, to ſcrape it off with a Knife of Bone or Wood, for in dry Weather it will not come off ſo well.</p>
                              <p>Moſs is a very great annoyance to Trees, <note place="margin">Moſs a great annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to Trees and Ground.</note> and to the Ground it ſelf, and is a manifeſt ſign of a defect of the more nouriſhing Juice that is in fruitful Plants or Soil; it is a ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous Excreſcence, as many other Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables are, which made the learned Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher

                                 <hi>Van Helmont</hi> ſay, That its Seed diſtilled from the Heavens; which is no more than if he ſhould have ſaid, that it proceeded from the natural inclination of the Matter on which it grew, animated by the Coeleſtial Influences, which gave it Life, but the Matter on which it grew gave it form, it varying according to the diverſity of the Matter, from whence it receives its Nouriſhment; ſome Moſs being hard, ſome ſoft, ſome White, others Green. There is alſo ſweet Moſs that grows on <hi>Apple-Trees,</hi> and <hi>Poplar-Trees,</hi> and the Moſs of the <hi>Larix-Tree</hi> is ſweet in the burning. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all theſe Moſſes are mere Excreſcences, yet do they bear Seed and encreaſe, as hath lately been diſcovered by a learned Vertuoſi, <note place="margin">Hooks Lampas.</note> who by the help of a Microſcope hath obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Seed-Cods or Seed-Veſſels of Moſs to contain Seeds in them, no leſs wonderful for the greatneſs of number than the ſmalneſs of bulk, which Seed-Veſſels when ripe, he preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them pretty hard, found that there was a ſmall Duſt went out of them, which ſeemed to vaniſh into the Air: preſſing and ſqueezing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of them upon a Black Plate, and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Powder with a Microſcope, he found it to be a great heap of exceeding ſmall Seeds, globular, and pretty tranſparent, Ninety Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand whereof extended in length, take up no more room than the length of one ſingle Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-corn, or a quarter of an Inch; and Twelve Millions of the ſame Seeds laid quadrangularly, cover no more of a Superficies than one ſquare
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:100170:126"/> inch, And 1382400000 weighing only one Grain. Eighty of theſe ſuperficies of Seeds make but the thickneſs of a piece of fine Paper, ſo that they be laid in a trigonal order, as moſt round Bodies uſually place themſelves, that is, the round part of the Seed bearing on the concave diſtance, between the Seeds in the neather lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. For the truth of which Obſervations and Narration, the ſame Author appeals to your own Senſe and Reaſon, in caſe you make uſe of thoſe artificial Helps he hath for that purpoſe. But his Concluſion is ſomewhat doubtful, that theſe Seeds being thus ſmall, may be carried in the Air from place to place, even to the tops of the higheſt Towers, or places remote, and be there ſown, from whence he ſuppoſeth proceeds the growth of Moſs, and doth not conſider that theſe Seeds being globular and tranſparent, (an Argument of their ſolidity and weightineſs) are as unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being drawn up into the Air, and carried far, as the Seeds of <hi>Peaſe, Radiſh, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlain, Thyme, Marjoram,</hi> &amp;c. For their ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is rather an impediment to their Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſportation than a help, and we find that ſuch Seeds that have a Down or Hair with them, are more uſually carried away with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Air, as thoſe of <hi>Thiſtles, Lettuce, Carrots,</hi> &amp;c. than thoſe that are more ſolid and naked. Nor needeth there any ſuch help as that of Seed, to beget Moſs, for it may as well natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally proceed from any place prone for it, as Plants of greater Bulk, it being not unuſual for

                              <p>Several ſorts of Flowers are apt to turn <note place="margin">Running of Colours.</note> White by long ſtanding, or removing into bad Ground, as Red and Purple <hi>Primroſes, Blew Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, Sweet-williams, Gillyflowers,</hi> &amp;c. which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from ſcarcity of nouriſhment, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring good nouriſhment to maintain the dark Colours; as in <hi>Tulips,</hi> the beſt and lighteſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours are preſerved by the more barren Earth, when a rich Soil turneth them to a plain dark Colour. But always obſerve, that change of Soil preſerves variety of Colours, ſo that it be to the degrees of fatter or leaner, as you would have your Flowers incline to darker or lighter Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>
                              <pb n="234" facs="tcp:100170:128"/>
                              <p> It is obſerved that there is more of White <note place="margin">Of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours in Flowers.</note> than of any other Colour in Flowers, and leaſt of Green, that being the general Colour, although in different Shades, of all Leaves of Plants, except ſome few Rarities that are Red or White leaved, as Red <hi>Sage,</hi> White <hi>Marjorum, Amarantbus,</hi> and ſome variegated Plants. In Flowers from White there are all ſorts of Shades, to the Yellow, Scarlet, and deepeſt Red, and to the Sky-colour and deepeſt Blew, with variety of Mixtures: It is very rare to ſee a Plant Green, yet there are ſuch, as the <hi>Roſe Plantain,</hi> being only a Tuft of Green Leaves, and the Green <hi>Primroſe</hi> hath perfectly Green Leaves in form of a Flower, but mix'd with Purple or White Leaves. The common <hi>Parrot Tulip</hi> hath a mixture of Green in the Flower, but it ſeems to be an Imperfection in it, yet it conſtantly bloſſoms alike. Black is not unuſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found in the bottoms of <hi>Tulips</hi> and <hi>Anemones,</hi> but no Flower is known to have a Black Leaf, ſave only the <hi>Bull Iris.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>There is a Sympathy and Antipathy in Plants: <note place="margin">Of Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Antipathy of Plants.</note> And many fabulous Traditions there are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them: but this is certainly obſerved, that ſome Trees will not thrive under the ſhade or drip of another, as the drip of a Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nut-Tree, and of a Cherry-Tree, are injurious to other Trees, becauſe the Leaf is bitter, and the drip deſtroyeth ſuch Trees or Plants that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it. The like doth the drip of the Leaves of the <hi>Artichoak,</hi> and of <hi>Hemp,</hi> which deſtroyeth all other Vegetables near it, thoſe Grounds being
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:100170:128"/> free from Weeds where they grow, from that cauſe. Some Plants will not thrive near o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, becauſe they draw alike Nouriſhment, and ſo rob or deprive one another, as Straw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berries and Flowers with Fibrous Roots, will not thrive together; but Plants that draw con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Nouriſhment, will proſper very well near together, as <hi>Rue</hi> and <hi>Lettuce</hi> together, <hi>Onions</hi> and <hi>Savory,</hi> or <hi>Lettuce,</hi> or <hi>Purſtain,</hi> will grow very near and kindly together.</p>
                              <p>There are very ſtrange Natures in ſeveral Plants, that are not by every one obſerved, <note place="margin">Perception in Plants.</note> which is a kind of perception in them, tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to that which nouriſheth and preſerves them, and eſchewing and avoiding that which injureth them. As a <hi>Cucumber</hi> is obſerved to grow towards Water, more than otherwiſe it would do in caſe no Water were placed near it; We may conſtantly obſerve the natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the <hi>Hop,</hi> the <hi>French Bean</hi> or <hi>Kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney Bean,</hi> and the <hi>Periploca,</hi> to a <hi>Pole</hi> or <hi>Stick,</hi> and how they twiſt about them, and how ill they thrive without ſuch Helps. It is certain that they have ſome perception of ſuch Pole, for you ſhall eaſily perceive their tender Buds to bend towards it, and at the leaſt touch of it to twiſt about it. After the ſame manner doth the <hi>Indian Jaſſamine</hi> or <hi>Mexican Creeper,</hi> and the <hi>Ivy,</hi> tend towards a Wall or Tree, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to it, with love and delight. Several Fruit-Trees alſo will flouriſh better againſt a Wall than ſingle, not becauſe of the warmth or ſupport only, but their affection
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:100170:129"/> to a Wall; as the <hi>Curran-Tree</hi> will grow much fairer, and bear better Fruit againſt a Wall than any other way ſupported, although on the North-ſide of a Wall: the like is obſerved of ſome other Fruits, as <hi>Plumbs, Filberds,</hi> &amp;c. The Roots of ſome Trees will run far towards any rich, fat, or moiſt place, it exciting ſuch Roots which have a natural perception, which way the beſt nouriſhment is to be obtained. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Plants will alſo avoid that which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light not in, as moſt Trees yield or recede from others that ſhade them; and many Plants planted near a Wall or other Fence, decline it, and lean towards the more open Air, be it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards what Coaſt it will. The turning of a Flower towards the Sun, or opening when the Sun appears, may be cauſed from the warmth it receives from it; and the bloſſoming of the greater <hi>Convolvulus</hi> in the Evening, may be cauſed from cool moiſt Air at that time, the Flower being ſo tender, that it withereth at the next approach of the Sun. But the inclination of a Plant to, and averſion from any thing, muſt be cauſed from a perception in that Plant of that in which it delights, or which it ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hors.</p>

                              <p>THE Seeds of ſome Plants proſper beſt when ſown as ſoon as they are ripe, as of <hi>Auricula</hi>'s, <hi>Tulips, Anemones,</hi> &amp;c.

It is obſerved that the Seeds of <hi>Angelica</hi> falling of it ſelf, or care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly ſown, when it is firſt ripe thrives well, which if kept and ſown in the Spring with care, as other Seeds uſually are, never grows: the reaſon may be, that it being a hot Seed, its vegetative Vertue may be expended by lying in dry or warm places, when otherways being in the Earth it may be preſerved till it ſprouts, which is uſually the next Rain; <hi>Walnuts, Fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berds,</hi> &amp;c. if planted before Winter, make ſome progreſs in their timely Shoots, but are ſubject to receive injury from ſharp Froſts, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, which to prevent, they may be kept in Sand in ſome cold or damp place, till the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of the Cold be over: The ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod may be uſed in the preſerving ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Seeds that are either apt to decay before the Spring, or ſubject to be devoured by Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min.</p>
                              <p>Some Plants thrive beſt, being removed from the places where firſt ſown, as <hi>Coleworts,</hi>
                                 <pb n="238" facs="tcp:100170:130"/> 
                                 <hi>Cabbages, Lettuce, Skirrets,</hi> and ſo of Flowers, as the <hi>Gillyflower, Stock-Gillyflower, Auricula, Anemone,</hi> &amp;c. Others like not to be removed, as <hi>Carrots, Onions, Radiſh,</hi> and of Flowers, <hi>Poppies, Larks Heads, Lupines,</hi> and ſeveral other Annual Flowers which muſt (if at all) be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved with care.</p>
                              <p>The Seeds of <hi>Cabbages,</hi> or <hi>Cauliflowers</hi> ſown <note place="margin">Carterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to prevent.</note> in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> or ſo early that they may be tranſplanted and well rooted before Winter: ſuch <hi>Cabbages</hi> or <hi>Cauliflowers</hi> are not ſo ſubject to Caterpillars, as thoſe that are ſown late be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Winter, or in the Spring; the reaſon may be, that thoſe ſown later being more young and tender, are more apt to breed thoſe Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min; or at leaſt, are more eaſily devoured by them.</p>
                              <p>As it is ſaid by Husbandmen, ſow Wheat <note place="margin">In what Weather to ſow.</note> in the Dirt, and Barley in the Duſt, ſo may we ſay of <hi>Garden-ſeeds,</hi> ſuch that are ſown in Autumn, as Wheat uſually is, may be ſown in moiſt Earth, a day or two or three after Rain, the Seeds will ſprout the ſooner, and be the better confirmed before Winter, but if ſown in the Spring, it is certainly the beſt way to ſow moſt ſorts of <hi>Garden-ſeeds</hi> as well as Barley in the dryeſt Seaſons, as <hi>Onions, Carrots, Peaſe, Parſley, Thyme,</hi> &amp;c. and moſt Flower-ſeeds, which being well covered, will by the coldneſs and moiſture of the Earth, ſwell and be ready to come up the next Shower; but if they are ſown in moiſt Weather, or ſoon after a Rain in moiſt Ground, they are apt ſpeedily to
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:100170:130"/> ſhoot. And in caſe dry Weather either from the Wind or Sun, which is not unuſual in the Spring, happen whilſt the Seeds are in their Milk or beginning to aſpire; it certainly kills ſuch of them that are not very well covered or defended, and then is the Seed blamed, as tho' the Seed were naught, which if ſown in the Duſt, and a Shower happen in three or four days after, thoſe Seeds, tho' never ſo meanly covered, rarely fail: only here you may take notice, that ſuch Seeds that are apt to be devou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Birds, as thoſe of <hi>Cabbages, Turneps, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhes,</hi> &amp;c. if they lie long before a Shower come, or be watred by hand, have need of ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence from their Devourers.</p>
                              <p>Many ſorts of Trees and Flowers naturally <note place="margin">Of making and taking off of Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets or Suckers.</note> afford Off-ſets or Suckers from their Roots, by which their kinds are propagated: ſome there are that afford them very plentifully, even to exceſs, as the <hi>Dwarf Almond, Hypericum Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex,</hi> and ſeveral others; and ſome there are that rarely yield any, as the <hi>Mezerion, Althea, Fruticoſa,</hi> &amp;c. It is therefore worthy of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to underſtand, how to cauſe Trees that will not naturally afford ſuch Off-ſets, to emit them from their Roots, the way preſcribed is thus: Make bare the Roots of the Plant of woody ſubſtance, and then make an Inciſion on the upper-ſide of the naked Root, as you do on the under ſide of a Branch which you intend to lay; make the Inciſion from the Tree down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and put a ſmall Stone or Stick under the Lip, to keep the Cleft open, then cover
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:100170:131"/> the Root over about three Inches with good Mould, and as the Lip in a Branch that is laid, will ſend forth Fibrous Roots, ſo will this (as ingenious Planters affirm) ſend forth Branches, which with the Root out of which it ſprings, may be tranſplanted ſecurely.</p>
                              <p>Some Plants there are, which are propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <note place="margin">Of propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating of Plants by Cuttings.</note> or encreaſed by Cuttings, as moſt ſorts of <hi>Garden-Herbs,</hi> and ſome Trees, as <hi>Evergreen Privett, Jaſſamines, Laurel, Woodbine,</hi> &amp;c. and ſome Flowers, as <hi>Wall-Flowers, Periwinkles,</hi> &amp;c. The beſt time for encreaſing Herbs and tender Plants by this way, is in the Spring, and from that time till the Autumn, only obſerve, that if you ſet any Slips or Cuttings in hot or dry Weather, you muſt be careful to water and ſhade them; but woody Plants that bear Leaves ſhould be ſlipt or cut, and planted ſome time before they begin to ſhoot, as the <hi>Woodbine</hi> in the Autumn, and <hi>Jaſſamines, Laurels,</hi> &amp;c. In the Spring, Plants propagated this way emit their Fibrous Roots at a Joint; therefore it is beſt to cut them off juſt at, or below a Joynt, and they will take root the ſooner, for ſo much Wood beyond the place of rooting, is apt to rot and hinder the young Fibres.</p>
                              <p>If your Tree be ſo high and ſtubborn, that <note place="margin">Of Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation by Circumpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</note> its Branches will not ſtoop to the Ground, then it is convenient to raiſe the Earth to the Branch you intend to propagate, but firſt take off the Bark of the Sprigs or Branch as near as you can to the Stem of the Tree, for the better ſupporting the weight of the Earth: If
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:100170:131"/> you cannot conveniently place it ſo near the Trunk of the Tree, you may ſupport it with ſome Stake, or the like; then take a Box, Basket, old Hat, Boot, or the like, and place it ſo, that the Branch may go through the middle of it, and that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked or cut place may be alſo in the middle, then prick the Bark on the upper ſide of the Cut with an Awl, or ſuch like Tool, to cauſe the Branch more eaſily to emit its fibrous Roots; then fill the Veſſel with good Mould, and in dry Weather water it ſometimes: This Application is moſt proper to be done before the Sap begins to riſe, and the end of the Bark of the Branch you intend to take off, will before the Autumn be furniſhed with Roots enough to feed it, without the aſſiſtance of the old Tree; then ſaw or cut it off, and plant it as you deſire.</p>
                              <p>Thoſe that delight in blanched Lettuce, may <note place="margin">To blanch Lettuce.</note> blanch them with expedition, by covering every Plant with a ſmall Earthen Pot, and laying hot Soil upon them.</p>
                              <p>It is thus preſcribed: Sow it in the Spring upon <note place="margin">To blanch Succary.</note> the Borders, and when it hath ſix Leaves, replant it in rich Ground, about eighteen Inches diſtance each Plant from the other, paring them at the tops: When they are grown ſo large, as to cover the Ground, tie them up in ſeveral places with long Straw, or raw Hemp, at ſeveral times as they grow fair, leaving the other to grow larger.</p>
                              <p>Or you may gently bind them, and take away the Earth on one ſide of each Plant, and couch it down gently, without bruiſing the Leaves, and ſo cover it with Earth, and it will become white in a little time, without running to Seed: Couch
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:100170:132"/> them all one way, and then they will not hinder one another.</p>
                              <p>To blanch them for the Winter, it is thus preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed: At the firſt Froſts tie them after the former way; about eight Days after make a Trench about the height of your Plant, then pluck up your Plants, and place them in this Trench; range them ſide by ſide, a little ſhelving, as they may gently touch. Cover them with rotten Dung of the ſame Bed they were ſown in; you may make Trench after Trench till you have finiſhed: Then cover the whole Bed four Fingers thick with hot Dung from the Stable, and in a ſhort time they will be blanched.</p>
                              <p>To preſerve them from rotting, you may cover them with Mats placed aſlant, to caſt off the great Rains.</p>
                              <p>Or you may take them into the Houſe, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them with Sand in ſome Cellar, obſerving to place them with the tops downwards, that the Sand may not run in between the Leaves: Let the Sand cover them four Fingers thick; when you take them up, ſhake them well with the Root upmoſt, that all the Sand may fall out from the Leaves.</p>
                              <p>Cover the Plants with reaſonable warm Dung, <note place="margin">To blanch Endive.</note> draw them out at the firſt appearance of Froſt; then keep them in Sand in your Cellar: Or when they are grown to ſome reaſonable greatneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhoot out any Stalks for Seed, take them up, and the Roots being cut away, lay them to wither for three or four Hours, and then bury them in Sand, ſo as none of them may lie one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or touch one another; they will by this means change whitiſh, and thereby become very tender.</p>

                  <p>AT the firſt publiſhing this ſmall Treatiſe, it was not my Intention to have added a <hi>Kalendar;</hi> by reaſon that I had compoſed a large one for Husbandry in general, which was printed at the end of my <hi>Syſtema Agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae,</hi> which contained many Directions to be Monthly obſerved in <hi>Horticulture,</hi> as well as in <hi>Husbandry:</hi> And alſo for that ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat a <hi>Kalendarium Hortenſe</hi> was publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. <hi>Evelyn,</hi> which hath not yet, nor is likely to be exceeded. But when this little Tract of mine was the ſecond time printed, by another Hand, in my abſence, was added about a Sheet and a half to it, calling it, <hi>The Gardener's Monthly Directions,</hi> which was collected out of an old Piece of Husbandry, much of it not proper, and other part of it out of uſe: So that I was obliged to compoſe the following <hi>Kalendar,</hi> which could not be done without repeating ſome Things that had been publiſhed before; yet there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:100170:134"/> neceſſary Directions which ought to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the Curious, not elſewhere publiſhed. Therein is alſo an Account of what Beautiful and Ornamental Trees, Plants, and Flowers, ſhew themſelves in their Splendour in each Month, that ſuch as delight in them may take ſuch care that at no time their <hi>Gardens</hi> may be without fitting Materials to adorn their Houſes or Garlands.</p>
                  <p>The former <hi>Kalendars</hi> that are extant are long, and there is not much more to be ſaid on the ſame Subject: Therefore you cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect this to be more large than you will find it.
